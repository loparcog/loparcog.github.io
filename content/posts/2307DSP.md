# L1: Introduction

- Digital has a lot more flexibility over analogue
  - Has a wild amount of applications today, but commonly before, used on analysis and synthesis of speech
  - Useful in coding as well for things like multiplexing
  - Also useful for seismic data processing
- Traditionally, we would record sounds through a recording horn, which would then write these vibrations to some sort of vinyl disk
  - This horn, however, does not have a flat frequency response, so there is some **frequency distortion** when using this
  - Using DSP, we can take recordings using this, estimate the recording horn frequency response, and counteract the effects it could have had on the recording
  - Also used to remove any background noise from previous recording methods, and could be used to even remove the instrumentals from these tracks
- DSP can also be used in digital image processing
  - Treat an image as a 2D signal and apply digital signal processing techniques to it
  - Eg. We may want to apply a **low pass filter** to remove grain noise from an image, or a **high pass filter** to enhance edges
  - Some things can be done that are usually much more difficult with other means like increasing contrast and reducing dynamic range
    - I don't know how hard this is usually this course is older than I am
- Much wider applications in things like radar, sonar, etc.
