*Feel free to check out this and other Silly Sound modules at [the GitHub codebase](https://github.com/loparcog/SillySounds) (they're well commented I swear). All of the code mentioned in this article can be found in [src/Lola.cpp](https://github.com/loparcog/SillySounds/blob/master/src/Lola.cpp)*

*Also if you are wondering, Silly Sounds is a mock Eurorack module company that these plugins will be published under. The company has and will never have profits, but is also a fake company, so we are planned to meet our goals year over year.*
