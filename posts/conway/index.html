What in the good name of Conway is a Conway Synthesizer\nOkay so, this one is going to come in layers. First off, Conway‚Äôs Game of Life. John Conway, a British Mathematician created the Game of Life in 1970, with the wiki found here and a playable demo found here. Both of those links would explain it better than I could, but essentially, it‚Äôs a zero-player game, setting a starting state and then letting the game run its course by deciding which cells will be on or off in each following iteration. The rules for which cells live and die each iteration can be condensed to the following:\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbours survives, having a healthy surrounding population. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell. All other live cells die in the next generation due to over or underpopulation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead. This in itself isn‚Äôt anything to ride home about, but, the patterns people have found for this game have been, personally, mind boggling.\nExample pattern in Conway's Game of Life A synthesizer is a synthesizer I‚Äôm gonna leave that rabbit hole for you to dive into at your own discretion. Give it a signal it‚Äôll make a sound, which can be modulated to be light and clean or extremely harsh and aggressive.\nWhy? ‚Ä¶\nThe main drive behind this one is wanting to get something musical out, but not being able to force myself to sit down at the piano and try to learn chords. I know how to code, so I thought this would be nice, and generative art is all the rage. Conway‚Äôs Game of Life has always intrigued me, and with such a simple backing, I thought it would be really interesting to try to add some musical aspect to it. This has been done before by others, as seen here, but many of these follow a step-sequencer approach, treating the y-axis as pitch and x-axis as time. What I wanted to do was get something that truly generated sound with each iteration, more like this project, but with more chance for user modulation and adjustment. Thus, the synthesizer part of the Conway Synthesizer. I also really wanted to utilize Tone.js after looking at it for past projects, and thought this would be a great use case. The project isn‚Äôt about the music I can make but rather the musical tools I can create for others, implementing the built up knowledge of Game of Life and applying it to a musical landscape.\nIf the why is pertaining to why I made a blogpost about this, I got bored of coding get off my back.\nHow? So x-axis is pitch, y-axis is‚Ä¶\nThis is the point where this document is very much alive, so take things here with fistfulls of salt. The overarching background for this is that everything is coded in javascript, with the synth sounds coming from the very lovely Tone.js Library\nThe Game of Life how is very simple. As stated above, there‚Äôs those three rules for how cells should be created or destroyed. For this, I‚Äôm using a canvas to create a grid of rectangles which can be toggled on and off, and when started, will continue to be toggled based off those rules each iteration. Small data structure for each cell so they have code on what to do when clicked and where they are on the canvas as well as in relation to other cells, index-wise. Easy peasy.\nThe SYNTHESIZER though, this is interesting. So, we have two axis to play around with. As I‚Äôm most familiar with piano, it seemed to make the most sense to make the x-axis change the pitch. Again, easy peasy, just set a number-to-key translation, which Tone nicely does, and set each cell to have it‚Äôs own note based on it‚Äôs x-axis index. Iterating the game now makes a mash of sounds, and the gliders sound like someone slamming their fist on the piano in lower at lower and lower points, or higher, however you set up your glider. To avoid some of this chaos, I removed sounds from cells that stay alive between iterations, and only set it to play sounds from newly generated cells. Still sounds like chaos, but much less so.\nBefore going into ironing out the x-axis, there is a giant design issue here. The y-axis. What does it represent? What sound aspect can be changed? What does Tone allow? All great questions, none too helpful. I‚Äôve currently still been playing around with some options, specifically things like volume, timbre, or oscillator functions like waveform and phase. As it stands, I still need to do some experimentation to see what would be best left to the Game of Life and what would be best left to the user, but I‚Äôm currently leaning towards the waveform shape being adjusted on the y-axis. The envelope would be a little messy since that‚Äôs like four different parameters, so I‚Äôm leaving that one to the user. Something else I‚Äôve been looking at was the Roli Seaboard, which has ‚Äúfive dimensions of touch control‚Äù, and essentially uses where you‚Äôre pressing on the key as another way to modulate the sound. It‚Äôs an interesting problem that I‚Äôve left for now.\nNow, ironing out the x-axis. Scrolling through all possible notes, seeing as how the Game of Life will commonly need cells to generate close to one another, doesn‚Äôt seem like the best solution to make things sound ‚Äúgood‚Äù. I‚Äôve though about playing around with scales instead, letting the user decide on which scales they may want to set the game to use, and then try an iteration and see how it sounds. Other options were maybe setting up chords, but for mass-generating machines, that would also sound probably too chaotic to be good. In the example above, setting portamento and release pretty high to get that spacey effect on all the notes would be a great way to merge them, but those would be parameters I would want to leave for the user, so that‚Äôs not an option.\n","wordCount":"1042","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-01-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Giacomo Loparco"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://loparcog.github.io/posts/conway/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"giacomo","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://loparcog.github.io/img/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://loparcog.github.io/ accesskey=h title="giacomo (Alt + H)">giacomo</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://loparcog.github.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://loparcog.github.io/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://loparcog.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://loparcog.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Conway's Game of Synth üëæ</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 31, 2022</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Giacomo Loparco</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what>What?</a></li><li><a href=#why>Why?</a></li><li><a href=#how>How?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p><em>This project is currently unhosted, and any code referenced can be found at <a href=https://github.com/loparcog/conway-synth>the GitHub codebase</a></em></p><h2 id=what>What?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what>#</a></h2><p><em>What in the good name of Conway is a Conway Synthesizer</em></p><p>Okay so, this one is going to come in layers.
