# School Note Site

This git site is mainly hosted to allow myself and others to store and access notes from anywhere, in a neat and organized manner. This is only currently for the 2020-2021 school year, since all of my notes up to now have been hand written, but in the current climate, I feel like moving over to typing notes in markdown would be a bit easier and cleaner.

## To Access
