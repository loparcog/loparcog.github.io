# My Personal Site Repo

Right now I'm trying [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/).

## How are you deploying

The entire project is in the Pelican directory. Entering this directory and running

`pelican content -o .. -s pelicanconf.py`

will put the output to the main directory where GitHub will fetch and host it.
