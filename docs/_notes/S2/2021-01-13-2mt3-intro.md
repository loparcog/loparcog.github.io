What is Music Therapy?
- A discipline in which a credentialed music therapy professional uses music purposefully within therapeutic relationships to support development, health, and well-being
    - Music therapists use music safely and ethically to address human needs within cognitive, communicative, emotional, musical, social, and spiritual domains
- **Canadian Association of Music Therapists (CAMT)** estaiblished in 1974, federal body, self-regulated and non-profit organization
    - Other non-regulated groups exist
- Need to get a bachelor/masters in music therapy to be recognized as a **Music Therapist Accreddited (MTA)**
    - Studies things like music as well as physiology, anatomy, biology, etc.
    - After 1000h internship and education, a **Certification Board of Music Therapists (CBMT)** examination needs to be taken, and needs to renew this in 5 year cycles
- Personal qualifications require abilities from both musical and therapeutic distributions
    - Musical requires not only strong musical knowledge, but improv knowledge and ability as well
    - Therapist requires good physical/emotional stability, interest in helping others, patience and understanding, general therapist things
- Some MTA's use the act of Psychotherapy, working under the **College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO)**, only applies to music therapists working in Ontario
- MTA works among all ages and diagnosis, something universally and long understood
- MTA's can be found in a variety of places like hospitals, clinics, group homes, prisons, private practices, etc.
- A session usually has three parts, will go more into depth later
    1. Hello / Greeting Song
    2. Music Therapy Interventions
    3. Goodbye Song
- Music therapy interventions can use one or many of the following:
    - Pre-composed music: Trying to evoke strong memories commonly which we may see and feel in those moments of time (not always positive memories)
    - Listening: Helps to develop cognitive skills like attention and memory, provide a sense of the familiar
    - Singing: Assists in development of articulation, rhythm, and breath control
    - Improvisation: Creative, non-verbal means of expression, easily approached and requires no previous musical training, helping to fill the void where words fail
    - Lyric analysis: Helps someone to find how to articulate their feelings and emotions, express themselves with pre-existing lyrics
    - Song writing: Facilitate self-expression, give structure to how someone is feeling
- Like other therapy types, it can be individual or groups, with or without parents
- Music used since it is a universal phenomenon (not necessarily language), accessible to all ages and cultural backgrounds
    - Is also flexible, can be used in many different environments
    - Can be used passively and actively
- Music therapy is **NOT**:
    - Something that requires the patient to have a musical background for
    - Entertainment, not playing live/recorded music or engaging in music as a hobby
    - Instrument/singing lessons
    - Special music education to teach special learners about music
- Process to receive music therapy
    - Referral (can be made by anyone, not just for a diagnosis or past music history, for a specific case of condition of the patient to try to solve)
    - Assessment (Can take place over one session, several, or ongoing, depending on case)
    - Goals (Based on assessment)
    - Treatment Plan (interventions, using one/many intervention types above)
    - Reports and re-assignments
