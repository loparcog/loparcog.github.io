Module 1: What is Environmental Science?
===

What is the Environment?
- The "old" view states that the environment is the natural world, apart from humans
    - Humans do not affect the environment and vice versa for this view
- More recent view comes around the second half of the 20th century, in which humans are part of the environment, and our interactions with it have consequences
- Environment built up of four interlinked systems:
    1. Atmosphere
    2. Hydrosphere
    3. Lithosphere
    4. Biosphere
- A **system** is a set of interacting, interrelating elements forming a whole
    - Each system interacts with one another, along with their parts
    - Some systems also have sub-systems
1. Atmosphere
    - Thin blue region around the edge of the earth
    - Mix of gas molecules, small solid/liquid particles, and precipitation
    - Gassiest part of the earth, from earth to merging with space
    - Without atmosphere, lakes/oceans would not exist
2. Hydrosphere
    - Liquid realm of the earth
    - Includes fresh, salt, and frozen water, although frozen water sometimes involved in cryosphere
3. Lithosphere
    - Sometimes called geosphere, encompasses solid earth
    - Includes all of the rock and geological material making up the planet
    - Also includes the soil, which is sometimes called the pedisphere
    - Landforms allow for habitats and nutrients
4. Biosphere
    - Encompasses all life on earth; plants, animals, and humans
    - Includes human economy, culture, technology, structures, etc.
- To understand all of these, we need to understand their interactions
    - The beings in the biosphere depend on the other systems, as well as other beings in the biosphere
    - Solar energy drives the energy which is shared and distributed amongst all systems
- **Environmental Science** is yhe study of how the natural world works
    - How humans affect their environment and vice versa

The Science of the Environment
- Science is a process of discovery
    - Essence is changing ideas
- Starts with observation of the natural world, boiling down to questions on what/how/why
- Science makes some assumptions of the natural world:
    1. The natural world can be understood by observations and analysis
    2. The rules that explain the observations are universal
    3. Science is based on a type of reasoning that is known as *induction*
    4. Generalizations are valid if they can be subjected to tests that can disprove them
    5. Science can never provide absolute proof
- Science aims to understand the environment through field research
    - Monitors the environment to determining its spatial and temporal variability
- In experiments, the relationship of variables is measured by keeping one constant and changing the value of the other, and measuring the change in the system/environment
- Scientific reasoning in experimental research combines both deductive and inductive reasoning
    - Different but complementary ways of thinking
    - If a conclusion follows logically from reason, the conclusion is said to be **proven**
        - This process is called **deductive reasoning**
    - Deductive proof does not require that the premises is true, just that the reasoning be foolproof
- Science requires not only correct deductive reasoning, but also that the premises are correct
    - This process is called **inductive reasoning**
- **Probability** is used to express how confident we are in our predictions
- **Computer Models** are used to simulate and predict future outcomes
    - Helps to work on tests with large, complex variables, simulating them instead of going through the challenging process of measuring and changing them
    - Can test the premises but not necessarily the final inference
- As with other sciences, numbers and quantitative values play an important role, allowing more than just a qualitative understanding of a problem
    - Allows for a visualization of relationships and for predictions to be made
    - Shows strength of relationships between variables and may uncover new ones
    - However, uncertainties need to be acknowledged and managed (ie. two trees of the same species are not necessarily the same, so need to account for those possible differences)
- Measurements can also pose an uncertainty, with biases being introduced through either mistakes in measurement or using flawed methods of measurements
- Measurements will therefor follow a statistical distribution that will fall around the true value of the variable that is being measured
    - The data gathered is a small number of a much larger set of possible samples
    - Each sample is a set of a population of data (ie. repeated testing of a value for a given sample)
    - Each piece of data is a sample of population of possible data
- Values obtained can be described by two characteristics
    1. **Accuracy**: Extent to which the measurement agrees with the true/accepted value
    2. **Precision**: Degree of exactness with which a quantity is measured
- When evaluating environmental science, one needs to ask a series of questions
    - What is the data underlying the theory?
    - Is there a logical link between the data and the theory?
    - Does the explanation account for all of the data?
    - Are there biases behind the explanations?
    - Does the scientific community support the theory?
- In general, if the idea is open to be disproved, then the findings fall in the realm of science, otherwise they are outside
