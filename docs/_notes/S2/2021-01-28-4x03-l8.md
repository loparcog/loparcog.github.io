Gauss Elimination Continued, Pivoting
===

Ex1: Take the following simple system:
    $$10^{-5}x_1 + x_2 = 1$$  
    $$x_1 + x_2 = 2$$  
- The "true" solution is:
    $$x_1 = \frac{1}{1-10^{-5}} \approx 1 + 10^{-5} = 1.00001$$  
    $$x_2 \approx 0.99999$$
- If we do gaussian elimination, multiplying the first equation by $10^5$ and subtracting it from the bottom, we get:  
    $$(1 - 10^{5})x_2 = 2 - 10^5$$
    We can round this to get
    $$1 - 10^5 = -10^5, 2 - 10^5 = -10^5$$  
    Therefore, our equation boils down to
    $$-10^5 x_2 = -10^5$$
    Giving us final values (calculating $\tilde{x_1}$ from equation 1)
    $$\tilde{x_1} = \frac{1 - \tilde{x_2}}{10^{-5}} = 0, \tilde{x_2} = 1$$
- Using exact calculations, we would get the following:
    $$\tilde{x_1} = \frac{1 - \tilde{x_2}}{10^{-5}} = \frac{1 - x_2 - \delta}{10^5}$$
    $$\tilde{x_2} = 1 - 10^{-5} \tilde{x_1} = 1 - 10^{-5}(x_1 + \delta)$$
- Can also do these calculations with the equations flipped, subtracting row 2 from row 1
- HOWEVER, we want to choose a row with a **large pivot**
    - The pivot is the number you multiply the row by to subtract it from the other row
    - Choose the row that will be multiplied by the largest number
- **Partial Pivoting**: Choose the row with the largest magnitude in the column we eliminate
    - Helps to avoid multiplying/magnifying errors

Ex2: Take the following simple system:
    $$2x_1 + 2 c x_2 = 2c$$
    $$x_1 + x_2 = 2$$
    Where $c \gt 0$ is a constant
- Using regular elimination, we would multiply the first row by $1/2$ and subtract it from the bottom row, giving us
    $$(1-c)x_2 = 2-c$$
- For a sufficiently large *c*,
    $$1-c \approx -c, 2-c \approx -c$$
    $$\tilde{x_2} = 1$$
    $$\tilde{x_1} = \frac{2c - 2c \tilde{x_2}}{2} = 0$$
    $$\delta = \tilde{x_2} - x_2$$
    $$= c - c \tilde{x_2} = c - cx - c \delta$$
    $$= x_1 - c \delta$$
- If we did this the other way of the rows, our error would be reduced due to the following (assuming *c* is large)
- **Scaled Partial Pivoting**: Choose the row with the largest ratio of pivot to the entries in the row
    - For 2 columns, just divide the first coefficient by the second to get the ratio
    - For $\gt$2, divide the coefficient for that entry with the **largest value in its row** (it could be the value you are dividing, resulting in a ratio of 1)
    - If two rows have the same highest ratio, choose one at random
