Exercises
===

Ex1: Vancouver Stock Exchange
- In 1982, the stocks were going up but the index was going down
- By Nov '83, index was at 532.721
- Each day there were ~3000 trades, each had a 3-digit rounding error
    - Would truncate instead of rounding

Ex2: Float Calcs
- Assume you have floats $a, b, c, d$, and do the following calculation:  
    $$a + b + c$$
- It would need to be noted that $a + (b + c)$ is **not always** the same as $(a + b) + c$
    - This also applies for multiplication operations
- Look at the calculation $1 + 1e^{200}) + (-1e^{200})$
    - This calculation can give you 0 or 1 depending on the order of operations
- Also look @ 1990's pentium chip bug

Ex3: Calc Example
- Given the following equation:  
    $$ \frac{e^x - 1}{2x} \approx 0.5$$  
    For what ranges of *x* is this accurate up to 10^{-15}?
    - SOLN:  
        $$\frac{e^x - 1}{2x} - 0.5 \leq 10^{-15}$$  
        We know that:
        $$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + ...$$  
        So we can then extrapolate this into the following:  
        $$\frac{e^x - 1}{2x} = 0.5 + \frac{x}4 + \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{x^3}{48} + ...$$  
        We can also know that 
        $$\frac{e^x - 1}{2x} - 0.5 = \frac{x}4 + \frac{x^2}{12} + \frac{x^3}{48} + ... \approx \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x^2}{12} \leq 10^{-15}$$  
        $$\frac{x}{4} \leq 10^{-15}$$  
        $$|x| \leq 4 * 10^{-15}

Ex4: Trig
- Take the following:  
    $$ x - sin(x)$$  
    Given a small *x* value, $sin(x) \approx x$  
    We can then go to the following:  
    $$sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}$$
    - NOTE: We get this all from the Taylor series
    - **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE TAYLOR SERIES**
- You should stop adding terms until the last term is smaller than your desired accuracy level, that is:  
$$\frac{x^{k + 1}}{(k + 1)!} \leq 10^{-y}$$
