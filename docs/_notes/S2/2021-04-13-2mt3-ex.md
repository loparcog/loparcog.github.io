Exam Notes

Week 7: Music Therapy and Mental Health
===

What is Mental Health?
- There is no health without mental health
- The definition of health by WHO:  
    *" Health is a state of **complete physical, mental, and social well-being** and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity*
    - Mental health is an integral part of this definition!
- Mental health can be conceptualized as a state of well-being in which the individual...
    - Realizes his or her own abilities
    - Can cope with the normal stresses of life
    - Can work productively and fruitfully
    - Is able to make a contribution to their community

Mental Health vs Mental Illness
- Is there a difference?
    - **Yes**, illness has a diagnosis, whereas health is something everyone needs to manage like how everyone needs to manage their physical health with or without a diagnosis

Aspects to Gain Support for Mental Health
- Two main divisions
    1. Looking for therapy/support for **proactive** help
    2. Looking for therapy/support for **crisis management** help
- In all cases, in order for therapy to be successful and most beneficial, the client...
    - Needs to commit to experience results (eg. when quitting smoking, if you join a group to help not for yourself but for someone else who has told you to join to quit smoking, you're not there because you want to quit smoking, so the likelihood of the therapeutic treatment being successful is less than if the motivation came from yourself)
        - Have weekly/regular sessions
        - Ability to reflect verbally/musically
        - Articulate goals or have an opinion on suggested goals
        - Have a desire to enter an alliance to reach goals

Is one MT Approach Better than Another in Mental Health?
- Depends on the client, setting, and reason for referral
    - What are the goals? Group or individual? Age?
- Can draw from aspects of improvisation, one of the psychodynamic models, etc.
    - Not usual but can also see things through Nordoff-Robins
- Mental health goals could include...
    - Enhancing self expression
    - Socializing with others
    - Self reflection
    - Managing symptoms of depression
    - Motivation

In-Class Article
- Purpose to see if music therapy was as effective as treatment as usual when working with inpatient clients to support them in self-expression, building relationships, and improving general motivation
- 144 inpatient participants, adults in mental health care with low motivation for therapt
    - Randomly assigned Music therapy or TAU
        - 72 impatient participants receiving MT bi-weekly for 3 months
        - Other 72 receiving TAU for 3 months
- All impatients received follow-ups at 1, 3, and 9 months respectively
- Study conducted in Australia, Austria, and Norway
- In the individual music therapy sessions...
    - 45 minute MT sessions 2x a week for 3 months
    - 10 different music therapists provided individual sessions
        - Using different therapist didn't seem to affect outcomes
    - Flexible MT manual developed for the study, ensure the MT was best fitted to the needs of the client
- Music Therapy approach was **Resource-Oriented MT**
    - "The client's resources, strengths, and potentials, more than problems and symptoms, should be emphasized, as well as collaboration and equal relationships"
- In the MT manual...
    - Focus on client's strengths and potential
    - Collaborating with client
    - Music improvisation
    - Creating songs
    - Playing pre-composed music
    - Listening to music
    - Reflecting verbally on music and musical interplay
    - Flexible changes based on client's needs
- What is "Treatment as Usual" (TAU)?
    - Medication (antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood stabilizers, psychotropic drugs)
    - Psychotherapy or psychological treatment
    - Electroconvulsive therapy
    - Counselling/OT, PT, gardening, SW
        - Didn't use all of these, put together options to best support the client
- Outcomes of the Study (Measurement scales and practices)
    - Primary: Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)
    - Secondary: General Symptoms BSI-18 (Anxiety, depression, somatic complaints)  
    Interest in Music Scale (IiM)  
    Motivation for Change - URICA subscales  
    Vitality, Social Relationships, etc.
- Results
    - MT effective for mental health care impatient clients with low motivation
    - Most primary and secondary measures indicate a significant difference between MT and TAU
    - Drop out rate less for MT vs TAU (shows engagement which is important, even over the successfulness of the treatment)
        - If you're not engaged you're not gonna get anything out of it
        - Also, it's difficult to *passively engage* in a music therapy session, which helps overall engagement

Week 8: Music Therapy and Palliative Care
===

Hospice and Palliative Care
- Philosophy of care - end of life (terminal illness, declining health, etc, many different durations of time)
- Team oriented approach
- Enhanced comfort and QoL
- Prevent suffering/relieve pain
- Guided by wishes of the patient
    - eg. Even if bloodwork would help doctors to identify problems with patient, if the patient doesn't want it, they won't do it
    - Can also be helped by relatives
- NOTE: Hospice and Palliative Care can be different in some respects, but for the course they are the same

MT in Palliative Care
- About living to the fullest - in the moment - NOT about dying
- What does MT palliative care look like?
    - Sound is the first sense we get and last one we lose
    - Helps for pain reduction and management
    - Helps to "embrace palliative care philosophy", person-centered not illness-centered
    - Palliative care not always "bed-ridden, non-verbal", many people actively involved in their day-to-day, just have a terminal illness
    - Non-intrusive, no need to ask how the patient is doing or handling illness, but can get the answers to this (mood, physicality, etc.) through regular instrument playing, song choices, communication and movement
    - Can also help family members to cope

Who Benefits?
- All ages of people who are terminally ill
- Family and friends by participating in the session (if the patient would like)
- Health care team (secondary, but music often helps the health care team to lower their anxiety and elevate their mood as well)

Hospice Team and Music Therapy
- MTs can focus the interventions across physical, emotional, spiritual, cognitive, or social needs
- Whole person
- Non-invasive, cost-effective (significantly less than pharmisutical costs for pain/mood management)
    - Shouldn't necessarily replace pharmisuticals, but can reduce their need
- Can be passive or active

Goals
- Psychosocial (anxiety, loss, spirituality, autonomy/control, isolation, family, cohesion)
- Pain Management, **most common symptom**
- Manage Dyspnea (shortness of breath), entertainment
- Manage sleep difficulties 

Biomedical Theory of Music Therapy
- "Analgesic" effects of music
    - Can relieve a pain, so strong such that in a study w/ no distraction, white noise, music they did not choose, and music they did choose, strongest effects was for the music they chose
    - Not just "distracting", but personal to work
- Distraction hypothesis

Use of Music to Impact Pain Perception
- Pain is subjective
- Increase in endorphins = pain perception reduction
    - Music enhances endorphin production

The Research
- Pain and Anxiety Reduction with Music (in courseware)
    - Koch et al 1998, Spintge 1989, Sehhati-Chafai & Kau 1985
    - Further supports pain and anxiety reduction in hospital settings through music

Treating "Total Pain"
- In order to lessen the experience of pain while in palliative care, one needs to treat the **total pain experience**, meaning the following aspects:
    - Psychological: Loss, symptoms of depression, closure
    - Emotional: Explore/express emotions
    - Social: Social interactions
    - Spiritual: Explore/express spirituality
    - Physical: Play an instrument/sing
    - Biopsychosoical Approach: Physically, social, and mentally involved
        - Physical not just movement, but elevation of endorphins and neurological responses

Psychosocial Support
- Can be achieved through engaging in music therapy, support palliative care philosophy
- Looking to support feelings of...
    - Anxiety
    - Depression
    - Isolation
    - Confusion
    - Grief
    - Impaired communication
    - Ineffective coping
    - Self-esteem
    - Relationship/family issues
    - Life review

Interventions
- Many different interventions can be used with a client in palliative care, including
    - Music listening
    - Improvisation
    - Singing
        - Music uses both sides of the brain, and can be maintained past social ability
        - Provide QoL and connect with others in a meaningful way
    - Song writing
    - Music playing
    - GIM
    - Lyric analysis
    - Iso-principle, matching patient's mood with music
    - MAR (music assisted relaxation)

About Jean (Courseware)
- Dementia and severe arthritis
- Living in LTC
- Pain management (new bandage dressings)
    - Way that her hand grips, the nails go into her hand
    - Bandages looked to ease pain, but changing them also caused pain
    - MT used to help minimize the experience of pain
- MT matched client's vocalizations
    - Vocalizations of pain from client
    - Matched along with guitar
- Change vocalizations to encourage deep breathing
- Improvising/reminiscent lyrics
    - Singing about the farm Jean used to live on or other memories
- More relaxed during/after MT sessions
- Caregivers also felt less stressed while changing dressings

About Bud (Courseware)
- ALS (muscles/organs begin to deteriorate)
- Weak, difficult to swallow foods
- Anxious due to laboured breathing
- Didn't want to see friends since he felt he couldn't relate with them
- Vocal and guitar movement provided
    - Work on vocalizing so he had more breath and better breathing
    - Was a guitar player before, so Bud also helped MT, gave him a sense of control and something he could provide to someone else
- Outcomes included...
    - Positive distraction
    - Anxiety reduction
    - Positive reminiscence
    - More comfortable for friends and family to join, could see Bud as Bud, not as a man with an illness
        - Less self-conscious about symptoms
    - Spiritual support
    - Control
    - Improve social interaction
    - Finding meaning and purpose

About Dan (Courseware)
- Non-responsive, end of life
- Difficult time for family members, unsure how to act or do anything
    - So many unknowns, unsure how to interact in final days with family
- MT previously aware of working with Dan, aware of music he liked
    - Shared music books used with Dan with family, family recognized songs and reminisced on memories from them
    - MT began singing songs and the family members joined in
    - Began choosing other songs that had memories for them about Dan
    - Way for family members to engage with Dan even though Dan could not participate
    - Had a "sense" of being with Dan with music and bringing memory back, sharing positive experiences
    - Understood that even though not responsive, Dan could hear the environment and music and memories being shared
        - Can be very supportive/meaningful moment for family members of people in palliative care
- Main takeaway that palliative care includes family
    - MT provided positive memories in a situation where the family felt helpless and distressed

Children in Hospice - Emily (Courseware)
- Not just people with long fulfulling life in palliative care, children can also deal with this through terminal illnesses
- Emily was 6yrs old with an inoperable tumour
- Wanted means of normailzation and output for creativity
- MT sessions with family (younger siblings)
- Wanted to sing with everyone around her, sang/was sung her favourite song repeatedly
- Recordings made for family, positive memories

Take-Homes of Courseware Examples
- Highlights how flexible the music therapist needs to be while working in palliative care, "adapt in the moment"
    - Clients can rapidly change, one day doing song writing with a client and the next they may not be able to cognitively engage with the therapist
    - Need to shift from song writing to more receptive music therapy interventions
- Singing, music listening, song choices are adaptable to all ages and levels of functioning
    - Makes it a great tool in this setting

Music to keep a Patient Awake? (Courseware)
- Why?
    - Back to QoL, if an individual is struggling with engaging with activities and others in the day but awake in the night, need to shift energy cycle
    - Using music can help make this better and more interesting for the client rather than forcing them to be awake

Bereavement
- Working with friends/family who had recently lost someone who was in palliative care
- Usually hand in hand with palliative care MT

Week 9: Community Music Therapy (CMT)
===

What is CMT?
- **CMT**: Challenges traditional boundaries and definitions of music therapy
    - Takes seriously how culture informs our ways of perceiving therapeutic needs
    - Seeks to develop new perspectives, role identities, and ways of doing music therapy
- Does not require referral, assessment, or treatment plan
- An approach gradually evolving in the field of music therapy
- A way of doing and thinking about music therapy where the larger cultural, institutional, and social context is taken into account
- The approach involves an *awareness* of the system music therapists are working within
    - It means that music therapy is not only directed towards the individual, but **often aimed at changing the system** that is sometimes part of the situation of the client (ie. negative stigma, lifestyle issues with current situation, etc.)
    - Even Ruud quote

Influenced by...
- **System theory** suggests an alternative to the traditional cause and effect model within science (ie. a circular model of understanding how phenomena are interacting)
- Video example
    - No leader, seems to be equality within group, opposed to a clinical dynamic where there is a clear view on who is the therapist/client and who is leading
    - More often a sense of autonomy for the participants in CMT than in other models
        - Still autonomy in other models though, just clinical goals are more clear on these, CMT is more vague
    - Not just the MT in engaging in music therapy, but also the job coaches and those working to help form autonomy for the patients

PhD Research Example
- Supervisor Dr. Laurel Trainor
- CMT - Effective for managing stress and anxiety in undergrad students?
    - Non-clinical
    - Psychological, physiological and biomarkers
    - Compared to verbal therapy
- Looking to be proactive for mental health and well being
    - Good as a society for this for physical health, but not mental
    - Also reduce stigma
- Results not to just help students in the group, but impact and make change beyond
    - How students access help, how students perceive help, make a shift from a reactive to a proactive model

Bigger Picture Goals in Addition to Specific Health Goals
- Typical CMT goals include:
    - Provider of vitality (eg. emotional stimulation and expression)
    - Tool for developing agency and empowerment
    - Resource in building social networks
    - Way of providing meaning and coherence in life (see Ruud, 1998)
- Example video (CMT with Refugees)
    - Focus on empowerment and working on strengths
    - Invite locals to CMT to reduce prejudice and increase community
    - Need to recognize how music affects each person culturally
        - MT recognized limitations and worked with other musicians to help connect more to others
    - Bigger picture goals of agency and empowerment, also for communities to bring awareness of the needs of the individuals
        - Various layers outside of the base MT work

CMT and Participatory Performance: Case Study of a Coffee House
- Elizabeth Mitchell (MTA)
- Adolescent mental health treatment facility
- Musical performance event (bi-annually)
- Youth and staff (facilitated by music therapist)
- Role of MT and multidisciplinary team
    - Provide support and help prepare before/during performance
- Purposes:
    - Support overcoming anxiety
    - Engaging in risk-taking
    - Enhance self-efficacy and confidence
    - Provide a "levelling" of institutional dynamics
        - Staff also need to participate and expose vulnerabilities, not exempt from this
- "Participatory ethos" at coffee house
    - Success = the act of participation not aesthetics
    - No judgement
    - Safe environment
    - Performing (sequential)
    - Listening and supporting
- No need to support, can still participate by helping out and supporting the safe environment
- Could be individual or in groups

Western Society and Music Making
- Expert and audience (a presentation) vs CMT (a communal experience)
- Not common for western society, used to expert and audience situation where you are either the performer hoping for good reception or the audience judging the performance
    - Coffee house unique in this sense, allow to musically express someone without worry of judgement
- Having a positive experience when making yourself vulnerable will stick with us as a very positive experience

Outcomes of Coffee House
- Increases agency outside of coffee house
- A new lens to see clients and staff
- Buzz of excitement in a setting often void of excitement/positivity
- An opportunity for creativity and normalcy
- How does the coffee house challenge the "system"?
    - Bringing excitement and creativity to mental health programs an example of this
    - Clients experiencing equality with staff
    - Feeling of "normalcy" in care center, even if not familiar to staff/client

Final Notes
- Which music therapy intervention can be implemented in CMT?
    - Music listening, improvisation, really any that work well in a group, super flexible
- Does CMT always include performances?
    - No, but it can
- Does CMT follow a clinical framework?
    - Also no
- Can CMT have clinical outcomes or benefits
    - Yes, many clinical goals can be reached through CMT
- Paradox: Music therapy is often not illness-centered, and can be experienced by a client as not a treatment - yet therefore helpful - because not viewed as treatment

Week 10 Pt 1: Music Therapy in NICU
===

What is NICU?
- **Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)** specializes in the care of ill/premature newborn infants
    - Neonatal refers to the first 28 days of life
    - A premature baby is born before 37 completed weeks of gestation (more than 3 weeks before the due date)
- Going to focus on premature infants for this course

Development of MT in NICU
- Music research began in the NICU over 25 years ago
- Medical staff resisted the idea that music therapy could impact premature infant medical outcomes
- Today, NICU-MT is well known in the U.S., not in Canada
- Specialty training in US, over 300 specially trained Board Certified MTs (MT-BCs)
- Over 50 research studies in refereed journals provide evidence-based methodology for NICU-MT and document important and unique infant benefits from music
    - Results primarily physiological

How can Babies Engage in MT?
- The two video-links posted provide different examples
    - Listening (sucking to turn on music)
    - Entraining (breathing/heart rate)
    - Making noise

Premature Infants: Perspectives on NICU-MT Practice (Article)
- Jayne M. Standley, published in "Voices Journal"
    - Journal of World Music Therapy Association (WMTA)

Family-Centred Care
- In 2004, a survey of NICU nurses in the US demonstrated that 68% wanted music included in NICU treatment
- Individualized developmental and family-centred care
- Just as important to support the parent(s)?
    - Yes, lots of uncertainty and anxiety with premature birth, such as plans with last day at work, plans for supports to come, etc.
    - Stress will be felt by infant, and also the child needs to stay in the hospital to be watched, causing further stress for the mom/family members

Training to Work as a MT in NICU?
- A formalized NICU-MT training program exists in the US (not needed in Canada as it does not exist)
    - The National Institute for Infant and Child Medical Music Therapy, approved by the Certification Board for Music Therapy as a continuing education provider, conducts the program through an affiliation of four universities and five medical centers
    - Training in three phases and consists of a minimum of eight hours of lecture, 16 hours of hands on training in an affiliated NICU, and completion of online tests for two text books
    - Hundreads of US and international music therapists have been trained, including people from England, Spain, Norway, Japan, etc.

Can Music be Dangerous?
- Problems occur when music is used in the NICU setting without expertise
- Volunteer musicians seek opportunities to perform in the NICU without knowing the consequences of overstimulation or how to use music to the greatest benefit
- Parents or other professionals sometimes bring toys or mobiles into the NICU environment with auditory components (eg. lullabies, heartbeats) without understanding the consequences for their own or nearby infants
    - Problems with overstimulation and volume
- Things can be made for infants but be bad for *premature* infants

Primary Critical Variables Measures
- **Physiological Measures**: Heart rate, respiration rate, weight gain, oxygen saturation, days in hospital, apnea, bradycardia, etc.
- **Developmental/Behavioural Milestones**: Behaviour state, ability to transition from state to state or self-soothe, feeding skill, and caregiver/infant attachment
    - In video, sucking on pacifier gave no food but would produce a music sound to encourage sucking behaviour, an example of a behavioural approach
- In order to clarify benefits of specific procedures, the music used should **be fully described** with careful attention to content, complexity, duration, and decibel (dB) level
    - See Standley & Walworth, 2010

Live or Recorded Music
- Research shows that music is effective in multiple ways, whether live or recorded
- Life music is the preference of the profession
    - However, there are too many premature infants for their needs to be fully met by the limited number of MTs available to provide services

Three Stages of Developmental Care of Premature Infants
1. Survival/pacification
2. Cautious stimulation
3. Transition to interactive stimulation

Stage 1: Survival/Pacification
- No touching, interaction, or disturbance of sleep
- Live or recorded music, with the fewest alerting stimuli possible
    - Very consistent and calm
- The therapist's face should be more than 10" from the infant to not overstimulate them
- Research in this area has shown that quiet, consistent music (less than 65 db, in scale of C) soothes, masks averse auditory stimuli, and enhance medical indicators of infant wellbeing like oxygen saturation
- Use of lullabies in the child's native language simultaneously promotes language development while pacifying and are specifically designed to soothe and quiet infants

Stage 2: Cautious Stimulation
- Touch and interaction is permitted
    - Mom can hold their child, remove from incubator
    - When removal from the incubator is permitted, then kangaroo care (skin-to-skin contact with the infant, lying quietly on the caregiver's bare chest) is highly beneficial and can only be provided by the primary caregivers
- Music listening during passive touch such as kangaroo care is beneficial
- Methods to elicit infant interaction with the parent or therapist are off limits until the infant can tolerate minimal stimulation
- Gender differences in response to this technique show males respond better to a capella voice if touch is applied, where females respond better to greater complexity such as guitar accompaniment for voice combined with touch
    - Example of where training in this group is highly needed (when to sing with/without instrument, when to touch, when to touch and sing, etc.)

Stage 3: Transition to Interactive Stimulation
- Music listening after distressing medical procedures to return the infant to a sleep state
- Infant must coordinate suck/swallow/breathe ability and build endurance for feeding indicated by satisfactory weight gain
    - Music reinforces sucking and facilitates oral feeding ability
- Systematic multi-modal stimulation is highly effective in promoting neurologic maturation that is evidenced by tolerance to the combined stimuli of touch, singing, and movement
- Infant must orient to and track visual and auditory stimuli
    - Music is an excellent cue for initiating tracking ability

Week 10 Pt 2: Music Therapy and Parkinson's Disease
===

What is PD? (Video)
- Estimated 600 000 to 1 million or more in US are living with PD
    - 60 000 diagnosed each year
- Increases by age, but can occur at 40 or younger
    - Like dementia, not a **result** of ageing, and different since many younger people can get it
- No main tests for PD, mainly look for resting tremor, stiffness, and slowness of movement
    - Usually think of hand shaking, but can also be walking and balance problems
    - Can also cause other things like loss of sense of smell, depression, stomach issues, etc.
- Same idea of if you've met one person with parkinsons, you've met one person with parkinsons
    - Very diverse conditions and symptoms, no standard trajectory or path
- Dopamine producing cells dying results in PD
- Thought to be result of genetic and environmental factors
    - Note vast majority not connected to genetics though, and head injuries and other things can increase chance
- How do we treat PD?
    - Current medicine cannot slow or stop progression, but can ease symptoms
    - Individual treatment plans needed, since cases so different

What is PD (Slides)
- A chronic progressive neurological disorder involving degeneration of the dopaminergic system
- Motor and non-motor symptoms
    - Common aspect is the motor aspect

Best MT Model or Approach
- Think about approaches we have discussed in the course so far
- Which approaches and interventions could be beneficial for symptoms of PD?
    - Neurologic music therapy can help with movement
    - Psychodynamic approaches can help with symptoms of depression and other emotional hardships
        - In Canada, first and foremost help is medication for motor, looking for emotional goals id far down the list
    - Impovisation can be useful, fluid motions paired with music often become void of symptoms
    - Can additionally use lyrical analysis and songwriting to explore feelings about PD
- Most likely a neurologic or phychodynamic-informed approach, but as known, there is no *best* model or approach
    - Use ones for give goals

Music Therapy and PD
- Use music to strengthen breath support and vocal movements
- Also help with fine motor skills
- In example there is a group, but can also be individual depending on goals and person
- Other therapies in addition to pharmisuiticals seems to help, MT being one of those

Outcome of Textbook Articles
- Looking at articles that explored the use of MT as an intervention for the symptoms of PD
- 137 articles, 27 of them met criteria to be reviewed
    - 20 @ motor symptoms (16/20 +)
    - 9 @ non-motor symptoms (7/9 +)
    - 8 @ QoL (6/8 +)
- MT interventions...
    - No exclusions in search
    - Passive (patient/client receives without any outward engagement, like MT playing music that has meaning for the client) and active (improv, music therapy, etc.)
- However, non-english-first-language reports excluded entirely, also reviews, case reports, and letters to the editor
- Classified into three categories:
    1. Melodic music
    2. Signing
    3. Rhythm (no melodic sound)
- Summary
    - A large range of study designs
    - Examples of interventions
    - All examples of music therapy?
    - Measures (survey of symptoms, physiological measures, etc.)
    - Supports the use of MT as part of treatment plans for PD
