Outline for Today
- Taylor Series
- Errors in Computing
- Mean-Value Theorem
- The Patriot Disaster

Taylor Series
- Used for an infinite differentiable (real or complex) $f$ at $c$
- Look over the slides for this

Errors in Computing (Roundoff Errors)
- Consider computing `exp(0.1)`
    - 0.1's binary representation is infinite, so the input is not exactly 0.1 but is actually $0.1 + \epsilon$
    - Along this, the `exp` function has its own error, so our answer will not be close
