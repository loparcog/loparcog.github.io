Exercises II
===

Ex1: Number Summation
- Suppose we have this equation:
    $$ 0.59 + 0.24*10^{-1} + 0.26 * 10^{-2} + 0.64 * 10^{-3} = 0.61724$$
- Now, what would happen if we summed with two digit rounding? Starting from the largest and working down...  
    $$0.59 + 0.024 = 0.614 = 0.61$$  
    $$0.61 + 0.0026 = 0.6126 = 0.61$$  
    $$0.61 + 0.00064  = 0.61064 = 0.61$$
- What if we sum backwards, from the smallest to the largest? (NOTE: Need to denormalize)  
    $$0.00064 + 0.0026 = 0.00324 = 0.32 * 10^{-2}$$  
    $$0.0032 + 0.024 = 0.0272 = 0.27 * 10^{-1}$$  
    $$0.027 + 0.59 = 0.617 = 0.62$$
- Which one is better?
    - Increasing error is $|0.61724 - 0.61| \approx 7.2 * 10^{-3}$
    - Decreasing error is $|0.61724 - 0.62| \approx 2.7 * 10^{-3}$
- **Summing by decreasing value gives smaller error**
    - Note that sorting would take $O(n)$ time, so would be more expensive though

Ex2: Float Operations
- Let *a* be a FP number in binary
- The operation $fl(0.5 * a) = fl(a/2)$ would give us an exact answer
- What if you want the middle of two floating points *a* and *b*?  
    $$a \leq fl((a + b)/2) \leq b$$
    - In decimal, issue when $(a+b)/2$ may not be in $[a,b]$
    - Recommended to do $a + (b-a)/2$

Ex3: More Trig
- Say you have the following equation:  
    $$\sin(x^2) + \cos^2(x) = 1$$
- From this, you can get:  
    $$\sin(x) = \pm \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(x)}, x \approx 0$$  
    $$\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!}$$  
    - Take an example of $\epsilon = 10^-6$:  
        $$\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!}$$  
        Double has 16-bit precision so in this case it would be smaller
- Overall, we get the following piecewise function:  
    $$\sin(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
        x - \frac{x^3}{3!} & |x| \leq \epsilon \\
        \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(x)} & \epsilon \lt x \lt pi \\
        - \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(x)} & - \pi \lt x \lt - \epsilon
    \end{cases}$$

Ex4: Solving Linear Systems
- Assume we have $A x = b$, where *A* is a *nonsingular* $n*n$ matrix, and *b* is an $n$ vector
    - Nonsingular gives the following properties:  
        $$\det(A) \neq 0$$  
        $$A * A^{-1} = A^{-1} * A = I$$
- One way to solve this system would be Gauss Elimination
- Let's say that our given matrix *A* is:  
    $$A = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & -1 & 3 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 \\
    3 & -2 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}$$
    - First we can multiply row 1 by 1, and subtract it by 2, and then multiply it by 3 and subtract it from row 3, giving us:  
        $$A = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & -1 & 3 \\
        0 & 2 & -3 \\
        0 & 1 & -8 \\
        \end{bmatrix}$$    
    - Multiplying the top row by 0.5 and subtracting it from row 3 gives us:
        $$A = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & -1 & 3 \\
        0 & 2 & -3 \\
        0 & 0 & -6.5 \\
        \end{bmatrix}$$   
    - We can now solve it in the upper triangular form
- How to solve this system
    - Look at this example of a matrix system:  
        $$\begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        0 & -1 & 2 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        x_1 \\
        x_2 \\
        x_3 \\
        \end{bmatrix} = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\
        2 \\
        3 \\
        \end{bmatrix}$$  
    - From this we get the following equations:  
        $$x_3 = 3$$  
        $$-x_2 + 2x_3 = 2$$  
        $$x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 1$$  
        And then we can solve for each value
    - This process is called **backwards substitution**
- You can also do this process with an **LU decomposition**
    - This would be used when $A = LU$, where $L$ is a lower triangle and $U$ is an upper triangle
    - $Ax = b$ would then become $LUx = b, y = Ux$
    - End off with $Ly = b$, find y, and $Ux = y$, find x
