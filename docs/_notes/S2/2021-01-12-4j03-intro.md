OSI Protocol Stack
- Stands for 'Open System Information'
    - Multiple layers from application to physical  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/osi.PNG)
- **Application**: Application-specific protocols
- **Presentation**: Format of exchanged data
- **Session**: Connection management
- **Transport**: Process-to-process channel
- **Network**: Host-to-host packet delivery
- **Data Link**: Framing of data bits
- **Physical**: Transmission of raw bits
- Top three are on host/user level, while transportation/network happen on host OS/kernel level, and the data link and physical happen through the hardware
    - Routers also deal with network, datalink, and physical, connecting the two physical sections of two separate hosts
- Layering concepts exist for these different layers
    - Higher layer protocols create messages and send them via lower layer protocols
    - These messages are treated as data by the lower-level protocols
    - Each layer adds its own control information in the form of headers/trailers
    - Use protocol keys in the header to determine correct upper-layer protocol

Internet Architecture
- Shown in an hourglass-like design

Network Interfaces
- Provide a communication service that higher-layer objects use to exchange messages
    - Seen as service interface to get from low level (IP) to high level protocol (TCP) of a host, and peer interface to get messages from two host's low level protocols

Performance
- **Bandwidth/Throughput**: Amount of data transmitted per unit time, ex. 10 Mbps
    - Link bandwidth vs end-to-end bandwidth
    - Notation is given as the following:
        - KB = $2^{10}$ bytes (roughly equal to $10^3$ bytes)
        - Mbps = $10^6$ bits per second
- **Latency/Delay**: Time for a message to be sent from *A* to *B*
    - Expressed as a time unit (ex. 30 ms)
    - Many applications depend on **round trip time (RTT)**
    - Components include the following:
        - Propagation delay over links
            - Assume roughly the speed of light ($3.0 * 10^8 m/s$)
        - Transmission delay
            - How long for the sender to send the data
        - Queueing delay
            - How long to wait until receiver accepts message
        - Software processing overheads
- Delay x Bandwidth Product
    - Channel = pipe
    - Delay = length
    - Bandwidth = area of a cross section
    - **bandwidth x delay product = volume**  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/dbp.PNG)
    - This is used to tell how many bits the sender can transmit before the first bit arrives at the receiver if the sender keeps the pipe full
- Note that RTT x bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that the sender can send before hearing from the receiver
    - If a sender waits for a signal earlier, the sender didn't fully utilize the network
    - If a sender didn't receive a signal after transmitting RTT x bandwidth data, something wrong occurs

Bandwidth vs Latency
- Relative importance
    - 1-bit: Latency bound/more important
        - 1ms vs 100ms latency dominates 1Mbps vs 100Mbps BW
    - 25MB: Bandwidth bound/more important
        - 1Mbps vs 100Mbps BW dominates 1ms vs 100ms latency
- All data is relative
    - 1 Byte = 8 bits
    - 1 KB = $2^{10}$ bytes = $10^3$ bytes
    - 1 Mbps = $10^6$ bits per second
    - 1 MB file to a 1 Gbps link looks the same as a 1 KB packet to a 1 Mbps link
