Media Access Control
===

Multiple Access Media
- Multiple senders on some media
    - Buses (Ethernet, all connecting off one line)
    - Wireless, Satellite (Shared)
    - Token Ring (Connected to one another)
- Need methods to moderate access to media
    - Fair arbitration (each node has equal access)
    - Good performance (overall throughput maxed)
- Why don't we adopt fully connected network topology as LAN (local area network) topology?
    - No need for packet switching, but the number of connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes, so it is impractical with many devices

Multiple Access Control
- **Problem**: Demands can conflict (eg. two hosts send simultaneously)
    - Solution is a **Medium Access Control (MAC) algorithm**
- **Potential Solutions** (of many)
    - Carrier sense multiple access with collision detections (CSMA/CD)
        - Send only if medium is idle
        - Stop sending immediately if collision detected
    - Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    - Token ring/fiber distributed data interface (FDDA)
        - Pass a token around a ring, only token holder sends

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
- Used by Ethernet
    - Xerox and IEEE 802.3 (10Mbps standard)
    - IEEE 802.3u (Fast ethernet, 100Mbps standard)
    - Current Cat7 cable offers 10Gbps within 100m
- Goal: **Distributed** algorithm that provides **fair and efficient** access to a share medium

Ethernet MAC Algorithm
- Sender/Transmitter
    - If line is idle:
        - Send immediately
        - Send maximum of 1500B data
        - Wait 9.6 $\mu s$ before sending again
    - If line is busy
        - Wait until line becomes idle
        - When idle, send immediately (called **1-persistent strategy**)
    - If collision detected
        - Stop sending and jam signal (inform other nodes that a collision occurred, letting them know to discard the message)
        - Try again later
- Given the following image;
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/nab.PNG) 
    How can we ensure that *A* knows about the collision?
- **Collision Detection**
    - Example
        - Node A's message reaches node B at time *T*
        - Node B's message reaches node A at time *2T*
        - For node A to detect a collision, node *A* must still be transmitting at time *2T*
    - For 802.3...
        - *2T* is bounded to 51.2 $\mu s \rightarrow$ Distance limit of Ethernet is 7000m
        - At 10Mbps, 51.2 $\mu s$ = 512b, or 64B
        - Packet length $\geq$ 64B $\rightarrow$ If capacity is getting larger, the packet size should be larger accordingly
    - Jam after collision
        - Ensures that all hosts notice the collision
- At time *2T*, *A* is still transmitting and notices a collision

Multiple Access Control
- Ethernet
    - All hosts share a bus  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/sbus.PNG) 
    - CSMA/CD
        - Collision detection
        - Exponential backoff
        - Inserting jam after collision
- 802.3
    - 2T is bounded to $51.2 \mu s$
    - Minimum allowed packet size is $10 Mbps * 51.2 \mu s = 512 b = 64B$
        - Hence, packet size $\geq 64B$
        - If capacity is getting larger, the packet size should be larger accordingly

Retransmission
- How long should a host wait to retry after a collision?
    - **Binary exponential backoff**
        - Backoff window size is power of 2, initially window size is 1 ($2^0$)
        - A node (discretely) randomly selects a slot in the window to represent the start transmission time
        - Backoff window size doubles with each failure
        - After *N* failures, $2^N$ is the window size, and there are $2^N$ discrete possibilities of transmission time
    - If busy, backoff window will be larger, and if not, backoff window will be smaller
- Consider the following w.r.t binary exponential backoff
    - *k* hosts collide
    - Eac picks a random number from $0$ to $2^N - 1$
    - If the minimum value is unique
        - All other hosts see a busy line
    - If the minimum value is not unique
        - Hosts with the minimum value slot collide again
        - Will then consider the next smallest backoff value

Wireless
- IEEE 802.11
    - A physical and multiple access layer standard for wireless local area networks (WLAN)  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/wlan.PNG) 
- IEEE 802.11 MAC Layer Standard
    - MAC layer standard for this is similar to ethernet (if two nodes are communicating simultaneously, collision can occur)
- Consider the following image of a **hidden terminal problem**, where A and C are both trying to communicate to B, but they cannot see each other, so they would both believe the signal is idle and send whenever, which could cause a collision at B, which A and C would not be aware of:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/htp.PNG)
    - The solution to this would be to implement a **Request to Send (RTS)** signal from the sender before transmission and a **Clear to Send (CTS)** signal from the receiver to any systems in the network to let it know that the network is clear and it is safe to transmit to B and let other nodes like C know not to transmit anything
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/htps.PNG)
- Another problem is the **exposed terminal problem**, where B is transmitting to A, and C wants to transmit to D. When B is transmitting to A, then C will hear this and think the line is not idle and not communicate with D. It could logically communicate, since the lines to not collide, but C will not since it does not see the line as idle:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/etp.PNG) 
    - The solution to this would also be through a RTS and CTS system, in which A and B can send their messages, and since C did not hear the CTS signal, it can send to D as well  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/etps.PNG) 
- **CSMA/CA Summary for Wireless**
    - Sender transmits Request to Send (RTS)
    - Receiver replies with Clear to Send (CTS)
        - If neighbours see...
            - CTS: Stay quiet
            - RTS but no CTS: OK to transmit
        - Receiver sends ACK for frame
            - Neighbours stay silent until they hear ACK

Example: Ethernet Timing (An example of CSMA/CD)
- Things to show:
    - CSMA/CD is a distributed algorithm (observation of the channel at each node is different)
        - Still works perfectly though, even if observations are not identical
    - As long as all nodes randomly pick up a retransmission slot upon retransmission in CSMA/CD, we can see fairness is guaranteed
    - CSMA/CD is efficient, since retransmission slot adapts to channel conditions
        - Backoff window gets larger for busy channels
- Scenario: Assume that hosts *A* and *B* are the only active hosts on a **10 Mbps** Ethernet, and the propagation time between them is $15 \mu s$, or 150-bit durations  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/scen.PNG) 
- Suppose *A* begins transmitting a frame at time $t=0$, and just before the beginning of the frame reaches *B*, *B* begins sending a frame, and then almost immediately *B* detects a collision
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/scen2.PNG) 
- Several assumptions:
    - All messages start with **64-bit preamble**, and the pramble must be transmitted atomically (?)
    - Upon detecting collision, host *A* sends a **32-bit jamming sequence**
    - Minimum frame size is **512 bits** (the 64-bit preamble is not included in the 512 bit frame)
- Does host *A* finish transmitting the frame before it detects that there was a collision?
    - **No**. *A* does not finish because it hears the frame from *B* after only 300 of the 64+512 bits are transmitted
- What time does *A* finish sending a jamming signal?
    - *A* detects collision at $30 \mu s$, then immediately transmits the 32-bit jamming signal, so *A* finishes at $33.2 \mu s$
- What time does *B* finish sending a jamming signal?
    - *B* detects the collision at $15 \mu s$, immediately after *B* starts transmitting the 64-bit preamble. *B* will finish transmitting the 64-bit preamble and 32-bit jamming signal, so *B* finishes at $15 + 6.4 + 3.2 = 24.6 \mu s$
- Jamming signals are transmitted by multiple hosts, but do the jamming signals collide?
    - It does not matter whether jamming signals collide or not, jamming signals are just **high energy signals** transmitted to ensure that everyone gets alerted that a collision happened somewhere, and no one should start a transmission
- What time does *A* first hear an idle channel again?
    - *A* hears it at $24.6 + 15 = 39.6 \mu s$
- What time does *B* first hear an idle channel again?
    - *B* hears it at $33.2 + 15 = 48.2 \mu s$
- **Retransmission**: Suppose each host next decides to retransmit immediately after hearing the channel idle. After the resulting (second) collision...
    - When does *B* next hear the channel idle?
        - *A* next hears collision at 48.2 + 15 = 63.2 \mu s$
        - Then, *A* has already finished transmitting preamble at $63.2 \mu s$, and *A* starts transmitting a jamming signal at $63.2 \mu s$
        - Hence, *A* finishes the transmission at $63.2 + 3.2 = 66.4 \mu s$
        - From this, *B* hears the next channel idle at $66.4 + 15 = 81.4 \mu s$
    - When does *A* next hear the channel idle?
        - Similarly, *B* hears the new collision at $39.9 + 15 = 54.6 \mu s$
        - Then, *B* finishes transmitting preamble and jamming signal at $54.6 + 3.2 = 57.8 \mu s$
        - Therefore, *A* hears the channel idle again at $57.8 + 15 = 72.8 \mu s$
- **Random Backoff**: Suppose after the second collision, *A* decides to wait **512 bit durations** to retransmit (if it hears silence after that long) and *B* decides to retransmit immediately after hearing a silent channel. Is the transmission of *B* successful? Why?
    - **Yes**, this time *B* successfully transmits the frame of 512 bits
    - *A* hears the channel is busy at 81.4 + 15 = 96.4 \mu s$, and while *A*'s plan was to wait until $72.8 + 51.2 = 124 \mu s$ to send, *B* takes the channel first so *A* keeps silent
- **Binary Exponential Backoff**: At the time *A* was planning to send its second retransmission at $124 \mu s$, it senses a channel busy. Suppose at that particular time, *A* decides to wait $3 * 51.2 \mu s$ more until its next retransmission. What time does host *A* finish sending its packet?
    - *A* finishes at $124 + 3*51.2 + 6.4 + 51.2 = 335.2 \mu s$
