Module 17: Soils and Water
===

Soil Water
- Three different types of soil water:
    1. **Hydroscopic Water**: Any water adheres to the soil, and is unavailable to plants
    2. **Capillary Water**: Water held in micropores, returns to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration, and is held in micropores of the soil, only water available to the root systems of plants
    3. **Gravitational Water**: Excess water that cannot be held in the pores of the soil, draining through the soil and out of the root zone, eventually becoming groundwater not held by the soil
- **Groundwater** is water contained within the saturated/phreatic zone of soil
    - **Water table** is the boundary between unsaturated/vadose and saturated zones of soil
    - Depth of the water table is how close it is to the surface, determined by infiltration rate, water holding capacity, etc.
        - Infiltration rate is the rate water can percolate into the ground, water holding capacity is the ability for soil to hold that water
    - **Evaporative water loss** is the depth of water loss from the soil through evaporation
- An **aquifer** is a layer of porous rock/sediment that can hold/transmit water
    - An **aquiclude/aquitard** is a layer of non porous rock or sediment that can hinder water transfer
    - Aquifer is confied when surrounded by non porous layers, limiting its ability to be recharged
    - No limit for an unconfied aquifer which interacts directly acts with the surface
- Volume of groundwater in a soil is a balance between mechanisms of recharge and discharge
    - Mechanisms for recharge include precipitation, but if it is insufficient, irrigation can be used to ensure a sufficient supply og soil water in the vadose zone
    - Groundwater naturally discharges through springs, which are lows in the topography that interact with the water table
        - Can also be discharged artificially through wells reaching a confined aquifer
        - If the pressure in the aquifer is positive, a well drilled at that depth will allow water to be discharged and collected

Environmental Problems
- May be several consequences to poor management of soil and groundwater
    - Eg. Overdrilling groundwater can lead to falling water tables, deep wells can create a "cone of depression" which would remove access for shallower wells near it
- Water also provides buoyant support to the soil surface by occupying the pore spaces in the subsurface
    - If the rate of recharge is equal to the rate of discharge, the soil support is maintained
    - If the rate of discharge is significantly higher than recharge, this support is removed and the land sinks
        - In some cases, can contribute to the formation of sinkholes
- In coastal areas, water from a freshwater aquifer lies above ocean salt water, since salt water is more dense
    - If water is pumped at an equal rate to the recharge rate, it will only draw freshwater
    - If pumping exceeds recharge, the fresh water will become depleted and salt water will intrude into the aquifer, making it unusable
- When the natural supply of soil water is insufficient, it can be supplemented through irrigation through a number of methods
    - **Gravity flow** is the most widely used, efficiency (percent of water dispersed that actually reaches the roots of plants) of 60%, 80% with surge valves
        - Water typically comes from an aqueduct system or nearby river
    - **Drip irrigation** has efficiency of 90-95%, where pipes/tubes above/below the ground deliver water to individual plant roots
    - **Center pivot irrigation** has an efficiency of 80% with low pressure sprinklers, 90-95% with LEPA (low energy precision sprinklers)
        - Water usually pumped from underground and sprayed from a mobile boom with sprinklers
- Irrigation supplies water to croplands by artificial means, and turns adequate soil into adequate cropland, but can also cause some problems though
    - Water logging, where soils are over irrigated and water fills up their pore spaces, meaning there is no air available to the roots, suffocating them
    - Salinization, where the accumulation of salts in and on the soil to the point where plant growth is suppressed
        - Fresh water contains between 200-500 PPM of salt, and this salt remains in the soil even after the water evaporates and accumulates over time
        - Salinization inhibits production in a significant percentage of all irrigated cropland, particularly in dry regions
    - Salinization can worsen problems of desertification, which is the deterioration of land in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid areas
        - Largely due to the changes in earth's climate and human activities
        - Land degradation caused by human activities has altered the soil fertility and structure in areas with marginal rainfall for crops
        - Issue currently affects most of the world's dry land, which is significant since many have high population density
        - Underlying causes of desertification are deforestation, overgrazing, and over cultivation, all affecting soil fertility and structure
    - An overabundance of water supplied through precipitation and irrigation can cause a loss of soil through erosion (different types)
        - Splash erosion is when the soil gets compacted as drops of rainfall hit the soil
        - Sheet erosion is where a more or less even layer of soil is lost from the land surface, occurs where rain and runoff from a rainstorm penetrates the soil, acting as a lubricant on which the top layer of soil flows downward
        - Rail erosion is caused by runoff water, creating small linear depressions in the soil surface
        - Lager volumes of running water result in formations of gullies (gully erosion)
            - Soil erosion caused by water may start a splash erosion, and over time lead to sheet, rail, and gully erosion

Module 18: Nutrients and Eutrophication
===

Nutrients
- A **nutrient** is any chemical required for the proper functioning of organisms
    - Either inorganic chemicals or organic compounds
    - Macronutrients are required by living organisms in large quantities, including calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur
        - Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are fundamental blocks for life, so they are required in large amounts as well
        - Carbon 45-60% of plant biomass, and others account for 0.1-6%
    - Micronutrients are required in small quantities and include chlorine, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc
    - Account for 0.0001-0.01% of dry plant biomass
- **Nutrient Cycling** includes the transfer, chemical transformation, and recycling of nutrients in ecosystems
    - Earth does not significantly gain matter from outer space or lose matter to outer space
    - Because of this finite pool, nutrients need to be recycled between ecosystems
        - This is fundamental to the sustainability
- The end and by products of one system/organism are sources of food and essential nutrients for another
    - Prevents accumulation of wastes and also makes the assumption that the ecosystems will not run out of nutrients
- **Fluxes** are transfers of material between compartments, such as soil, air, or the biosphere
    - Each compartment acts as a reservoir, receiving through inputs and losing through outputs
    - Occur at specific rates and can vary over time
- **Nutrient Budget** is a quantitative estimate of the rates of nutrient input and output from an ecosystem and within the system
    - Each compartment stores set quantities of nutrients, which remain there for a set amount of time, called the **residence time**
    - Sources are compartments that release nutrients faster than they get replenished, while sinks accumulate over time
- Two important abiotic processes; the burial and mineralisation of carbon on land and in the oceans, and the weathering of carbon minerals and combustion of fossil fuels
    - ~ 1/6 of atmospheric CO2 is taken up by photosynthesis and an equivalent amount is released in respiration
- Phosphorous is found in rocks and minerals as phosphates and is therefore a slow release process
    - Typically bound to an insoluble chemical, limiting availability to living organisms
    - Does not have a gas phase, only recycled if the water containing it are deposited in the ecosystem from which it came
    - Phosphorous availability is a strong control on the productivity in ecosystems; mostly used in fertilizers by humans increasing the amount in soils and surface waters
- Nitrogen similar to phosphorous, often a limiting factor to living organisms
    - Does have a gas phase though
    - Human activity affects this though fossil fuel combustion, releasing nitrous oxides
    - Most important processes of the cycle are mediated by bacteria through nitrogen fixation and denitrification

Lakes
- Surface waters are divided between the **photic zone**, illuminated by the sun, and the **profundal zone**, which receives no sunlight
    - Means that any process that requires sunlight occurs in the photic zone
- Similar to oceans, lakes are usually thermally stratified
    - Circulation patterns driven by temperature, maximum water density occurring at 4 degrees Celsius at the bottom of the lake
- Lakes can be divided into different thermal zones
    - **Epilimnion** is the shallow, wind-stirred portion, its depth determined by the strength of the wind
    - **Metalimnion** below this, zone where thermal Klien is located, which is the depth which temperature decreases rapidly
    - **Hypolimnion** is the deep cold
- Thermal stratification sets in in the summer, when the warmer and lighter water floats on top of the denser and cooler water
    - In spring/fall, the temperature of the atmosphere over the lakes cools, so temperature profiles are nearly uniform from top to bottom
    - Temperature profile called **isothermal**
- In summer, the wind action is only capable of mixing the epilimnion since the water at the bottom of the lake is too dense
    - As a result, no connection between processes occuring at the surface and bottom of the lake
- In winter, the lake is isolated from atmospheric influences by the lighter ice cover that floats at the top
    - Little circulation within the lake
- Spring/fall temperatures nearly uniform, so circulation occurs throughout lake

Eutrophication
- **Eutrophication** is a natural process taking place in water bodies, characterized by a development towards an environment rich in nutrients and increased primary productivity
    - Nutrient levels above normal concentrations results in increased algal growth
    - Takes years or more to develop, so lakes can be categorized by their nutrient supply
- An **oligotrophic lake** has low supply relative to the volume of water
    - Low density of primary producers, algae, and submerged plants occurring at various steps
    - Water is transparent
    - Well oxyginated as well, only in lake sediments are oxygen levels low as a result of decomposition of organic matter
- **Eutrophic lakes** have high nutrient content relative to their volume, characterized by dense growth of algae in the surface water, resulting in water column becoming turbid
    - Bottom waters have little to no oxygen due to the decomposition of dead algae
        - Even more apparent in summer due to thermal stratification
    - Many aquatic species suffocate and die under these conditions since they are not able to breathe
- Development of eutrophic lakes (eutrophication) occurs over several steps
    - Initially, lake is oligotrophic
    - Nutrient enrichment occurs, resulting in algale such as phytoplankton to grow, resulting in increased water turbidity, shading out the sub aquatic vegetation which then dies from lack of sun
        - It is now eutrophic
    - Loss of food and habitat for other species, oxygen plummets and algae blooms
    - Phytoplankton die off and rains down from the top of the water column, increasing detritus of the bottom
    - Feeders and decomposers consume all available oxygen as they break down dead algae, and chemical reactions increase oxygen demand, killing fish
