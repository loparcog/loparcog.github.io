Floating Point: Cancellations
===

Cancellations and Relative Error
- Suppose you want to subtract two numbers, $x-y$, The float error **without roundoff** would be $fe(x) - fe(y)$
    - The **relative error** for this would be the following:  
        $$ \left| \frac{fe(x) - fe(y) - (x-y)}{x-y} \right|$$  
        $$ = \frac{|(fe(x) - x) - (fe(y) - y)|}{|x-y|}$$  
        $$ \leq \frac{|fe(x) - x| + |fe(y) - y|}{|x-y|}$$  
        - Note, we get this from $|a - b| \leq |a| + |b|$
    - When $x \approx y$, the denominator is very small, making the error very large
- Ex: Take $x = 9.32450001, y = 9.23455001$
    - With 5-digit roundoff, we would get $fe(x) = 9.2345, fe(y) = 9.2346$, where each number has a roundoff error
    - Calculating the relative error using the equation above gives us:  
        $$\left| \frac{fe(x) - fe(y) - (x-y)}{x-y} \right| = 1$$  
    - However, if you do addition instead of subtraction, you would get:  
        $$\left| \frac{fe(x+y) - (x+y)}{x+y} \right| \approx 2.7 * 10^{-6}$$
- Recall an earlier example $\sqrt{x+1} - \sqrt{x}$, which simplifies to:  
    $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x+1} + \sqrt{x}}
    - When *x* is large, say, 100 000, and we round it to 5 digits, that would mean:  
        $$x + 1 = 100 001 \approx 100 000$$
    - From this, we would then get:  
        $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{10^5} + \sqrt{10^5}}$$
    this gives us an actual number, in comparison with the original equation which just gives us 0
- What about $x^2 - y^2, (x-y)(x+y)$, where $|x| \approx |y|$
    - Squaring the values would cause roundoff, and then subtracting the values would provide even more cancellation
        - Would be better to to the fractioned version than the squared
    - Let $a = x^2 - y^2$, and $b = (x-y)(x+y)$  
    Using matlab, we can convert values for accuracy using the `vpa` command, specifying the number of digits to use. In this code block, the input x would be a double, whereas the output would be a 32-digit number:  
        ```
        x = vpa(x, 32)
        ```
    - We can then evaluate *a* and *b* normally, and then convert to higher precision and see the difference between the high precision values and the roundoff values
        - This would show the error of *a* with some test values given as $1.0 * 10^{-17}$, whereas the error of *b* is somewhere around $2.7 * 10^{-7}$, giving much higher accuracy
- Look at quadratic equation, for $ax^2 + bx + c$, we get:  
    $$x_{1,2} = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
    - Problems can arise when $b^2 \gg 4 |ac|$, since then, $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \approx b$
    - If $b \gt 0$, then $-b + \approx b$ isn't okay since it would be 0, we would need to have $-b - \approx b$, the inverse is also true for when $b \lt 0$
        - How to get around this?
    - We know $x_1 x_2 = c/a$, so for $b \gt 0$, we can then work with:  
        $$x_1 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, x_2 = c / (2 x_1)$$
    - Likewise, for $b \lt 0$:  
        $$x_1 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, x_2 = c / (2 x_1)$$
    - Using these formulas prevents cancellations, and provides an accurate answer
        - **AVOID ONLINE CALCULATORS FOR THIS REASON**
