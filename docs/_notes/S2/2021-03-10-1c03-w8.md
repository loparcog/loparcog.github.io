Module 13: Oceanic Current
===

Surface Currents
- Several factors drive the circulation of water in the ocean
    - **Temperature**: Warm water is less dense than cold water, and this difference induces the flow of water
    - **Salinity**: Impacts the density of water, more salt more dense
    - **Wind Action at the Surface**
- Ocean is made up of different thermal zones
    - At the surface is a warm layer, mixed by waves and wind, present at low and mid latitudes
    - The thermocline is a zone of sharp decrease in temperature, therefore representing a density barrier
    - At the bottom and along the ground is the very cold and deep ocean, with temperatures near freezing
        - Has a much higher density than the mixed layer
- **Ocean Currents** are persistent and horizontal movements of ocean water
    - At the surface they are driven by the friction from prevailing winds, allowing the exchange of heat from low to high altitudes
    - Direction of the water drift is influenced by the Coriolis Force, creating an "ekman spiral"
    - Direction and magnitude of ocean currents is currently studied using drifting buoys equipped with radio transmitters, which are placed at regular intervals in the ocean by research vessels
        - Drifters transmit their position to satellites which is then forwarded to ground based monitoring stations
- An **Ekman Spiral** is generated by surface currents that do noe move in the same direction as the wind and whose speed and direction is not uniform with depth
    - Speed decreases and the angle relative to the direction of the wind increases with depth
    - At the surface, the angle is 45 degrees relative to the wind (to the right in the NH, left in the SH)
    - NOTE: No wind-driven currents below 100m
- **Gyres** are large scale circular currents bounded by continents and turn under the subtropical heights
    - One of these currents generates the west wind drift, which moves from east to west
    - Another is the western boundary currents, which are at the western edge of the gyres and are strong polewards currents (eg. Gulf Stream)
    - Eastern boundary currents are at the east edge of gyres, oriented toward the equator with upwelling bringing cool water to the surface
- **Upwelling** occurs when wind parallel to the shore moves surface water away from the shoreline
    - The warm surface waters are replaced by colder waters from below
    - Associated with stable air and dry conditions
- In the NH of the Atlantic, the Gulf Stream gives rise to the North Atlantic drift
    - Gulf stream brings heat poleward from the subtropics, giving rise to the North Atlantic drift which warms northwest Europe
    - Also a similar but weaker drift in the Pacific
- In the SH the currents are weak except for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current

Thermohaline Circulation
- **Thermohaline Circulation** is a slow circuit of deep currents starting from 1km below the surface to the ocean bottom
    - Begins as surface currents reached the water near Greenland and become colder, saltier, and more dense
    - Water then sinks to the ocean depths in the high latitude waters of the North and South Atlantic and formed deep water currents, which are coupled to the slow surface circulation
    - Creates a 3D network of currents at the global scale, driven by temperature and salinity differences
- The North Atlantic Deepwater goes South of Africa and joins water from the South Atlantic
    - Here, it meets the Antarctic intermediate water and the Antarctic bottom water
    - Eventually, water upwells into the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and some makes its way back to the Atlantic
- Characteristics of deep ocean currents are measured with profiling floats, guided by satellites 
    - Given instructions to sync for a period of time during which they collect info such as water temperature and salinity
    - After a few days, they emerge at the surface where they relay info collected
    - Understanding deep ocean currents is an internation effort
    - Understand ocean circulation works similarly to a conveyor belt
- The Warm Atlantic surface water slowly moves North through the Equatorial and tropical zones
    - As this surface water warms, evaporation occurs and it becomes saltier, which slightly increases its density
    - As this water continues to move to higher latitudes, it cools and becomes even more dense
    - Eventually the surface layer becomes dense enough to sink, occurring in localized regions of the north and south Atlantic
    - Carried along the bottom, all dense water flows southward, eventually reaching the Southern Ocean and flowing around the Antarctic continent
    - Eventually it is carried into Indian and Southern Pacific oceans, which force less dense water to upwell towards the surface
    - The upwelled water from the Pacific moves through the Indonesian seas and into the Indian Ocean, where it joins the upwelling water there
        - Some of the upwelled water flows southward, rejoining the circumpolar current
    - However, some of the flow escapes to the west around the south tip of Africa to enter the south Atlantic and joins the Gulf Stream, completing the circuit

El Nino
- **El Nino** coincides with a time of unusually warm water off the coast of Peru and Australia, called the Southern Oscillation
    - Also known as ENSO
    - Occurs ever ~3-8 years
    - **La Nina** is a pronounced reversal of normal conditions
- When conditions are normal in the South Pacific Ocean, temperatures are lower over the eastern Pacific and higher over the western Pacific
    - This sets up a pressure gradient that drives easterly winds
- Easterly tradewinds produce a westward ocean current, moving warmer waters to the west
    - As a result, the eastern Pacific cold bottom waters replace the warm water by upwelling
    - The cold water that upwells lowers the temperature of the atmosphere above while the westward current raises the temperature off the coast of Australia, intensifying the initial temperature gradient
- Warm moist air rises off the coast of Australia and convective rainfall occurs
    - The air now aloft has lost its moisture and returns to the eastern Pacific through the global atmospheric circulation where it subsides
- During El Nino conditions, there is a reduced difference in ocean temperature
    - As temperature over the eastern Pacific increases, temperatures over the western pacific decrease
    - As a result, the pressure gradient, helping to drive easterly tradewinds, weakens
    - Weaker easterly tradewinds produces a weaker westward current
    - The warm water piled up over the western Pacific surges back to the central Pacific
    - Less upwelling of cold water takes place in the eastern Pacific, and there is less cold water at the surface
    - Reduction of the westward current lowers the temperature off the coast of Australia, weakening the temperature gradient even further 
    - As a result, collective rainfall tends to occur instead over the central and eastern Pacific

Module 14: Global Climate
===

Factors Controlling Climate
- An **air mass** is an extremely large body of air whose temperature and humidity are uniform both horizontally and vertically
    - The areas of the globe where air masses form are called **source regions**
    - Large bodies of air must remain over a source region for a substantial amount of time for an air mass to form
    - Air masses affect vast areas, with temperature and humidity characteristics matching their source region
- Air masses are classified by their origin in terms of latitude and surface type
    - Categories use a lowercase letter for surface and uppercase for latitude
        - m: Maritime, c: Continental
        - A: Arctic, AA: Antarctic, P: Polar, T: Tropical, E: Equatorial
    - Latitude indicates temperature of air mass, surface indicates moisture content
- Source regions are where an air mass originates and usually has a flat and uniform composition with light surface winds
    - Air masses can travel over a source region for any substantial amount of time and have their properties changed because of it
- Air masses can also go through changes over the seasons
    - The temperature of an air mass changes rapidly over the surface in winter since it is so cold, change stays sorta constant for summer to atmospheric change
- One factor influencing the annual cycle of air temperatures in a location is its latitude
    - Annually, the lower latitudes receive more insulation than higher latitudes, having a higher than average annual temperature
    - Low climates also have little seasonal variation in comparison
- Another influencing factor is location
    - Coastal locations have a more uniform cycle than continental
- Elevation also influences the annual cycle of air temperatures
    - Due to environmental lapse rate, higher altitudes will be cooler than lower ones if all other factors are the same
- The latitude, continentality, and elevation of a location also influence the cycle of annual precipitation
    - Annual and daily cycles also play an important role in this
    - The atmosphere can hold more moisture at higher temperatures, generally associated with higher total precipitation
- The origin of prevailing air masses is also an important factor
    - Air coming from source regions that are continental/cold, like the polar Arctic, tend to hold less moisture than air from warm tropical or maritime sources
- Mountain barriers also affect precipitation
    - Areas on the windward side are subject to orographic precipitation, whereas the lee side tend to have rain shadows
- Proximity to the persistent low and high pressure centers in earths atmosphere is another factor
    - Areas under the constant influence of the persistent lows tend to receive substantial convective precipitation
    - Areas under the high pressure centers received less precipitation (areas like the Sahara)
- Prevailing winds and nearby ocean currents also have an impact on precipitation
    - Moist air from the Pacific creates ideal temperature and moisture conditions for temperate rainforests

Temperature and Precipitation Regimes
- A **Temperature Regime** is the annual cycle of temperature in a place due to its latitude and location
    - Main control is the annual variation and insulation, a result of latitude
    - Effect of a marine or continental location will either moderate or amplify variation
    - Annual cycle of air temperature in maritime is unaffected, but the annual temperature for marine locations is impacted by latitude
        - Marine location results in a fairly uniform temperature year round
    - Continental average temperature similarly impacted by latitude, but cycles are impacted stronger by their locations, with variation growing with latitude
- Variations in worldwide climate can be classified according to different schemes
    - eg. The **Koeppen Classification**
    - Criteria to distinguish different climate types can include amount of moisture held in soil, air mass movements reflecting the latitude of the source region, temperature, and surface type
    - Both act as controls on local temperature and precipitation
-A **Climograph** shows the climate of a given location or region using two or more variables
    - eg. the mean monthly temperature on a line chart and the mean monthly precipitation on a bar chart
    - May also include dominant weather systems (eg. influence of ITCZ)
- Climates can largely be distinguished based on their moisture regime
    - A moist climate is where the soil remains moist all year, hosting perennial streams and supports forests/tall grasses
    - A dry climate is where evaporation exceeds precipitation by a wide margin, further distinguished from a steppe climate where the soil remains moist for part of the year and an arid climate in which the soil is almost never moist
- The steppe can be thought of as a transition between a moist climate and a dry climate
    - Few perennial streams and sparse vegetation made of grasses and shrubs
- A **Precipitation Regime** is a pattern of precipitation determined by air masses 
    - Can be recognized by following the "isohyats" on a map, the lines drawn through areas with equal annual precipitation, helping to define precipitation regions
    - At low latitudes, the areas under the influence of the subtropical highs are either arid or semi-arid
    - Areas under the influence of the trade winds are either wet, humid, or sub-humid
    - At high latitudes, the areas under the direct influence of the westerlies are wet, whereas the interior of the continents are humid or more frequently sub-humid
    - The polar regions are deserts
- There are **seven global precipitation regions**:
    - The **Wet Equatorial Belt** has more than 2000mm annually of rainfall, dominated by maritime equatorial air masses, causing heavy convective rainfall
        - Region corresponds to rainforest of the Amazon in West Africa
    - The **Trade-Wind Coasts** have 1500-2000mm of precipitation annually, dominated by NT or maritime tropical air masses carried by the trade winds
        - Occupy narrow belts from the equator to 30 degrees N/S on the East Cost of the continents
        - Central America and Madagascar
    - **Tropical Deserts** have less than 250mm of rainfall, dominated by CT or Continental Tropical air masses under the influence of the subtropical highs, and are located on or near the tropics
        - Sahara Desert
    - **Midlatitude Deserts and Steppes** receive between 100-500mm of precipitation, located in the rain shadow of mountain chains and the center of continents between 30-50 degrees N
        - Death Valley in USA
    - **Moist Subtropical** receives between 1000-1500mm in precipitation, dominated by maritime tropical, or MT, air masses from the ocean
        - Located 25-40 degrees N/S on the west end of subtropical highs
        - Florida
    - **Midlatitude West Coast Regime** receives 1500-2000mm in precipitation, dominated by maritime polar air masses
        - Scotland, BC
    - **Arctic and Polar Deserts** receive less than 300mm of rainfall, dominated by CP, or continental polar and CAE or continental arctic air masses above 60 degrees latitude N/S
        - Because of the low temperature, little moisture is in the air
- Water and temperature are two of the most important factors shaping the composition of ecosystems
    - Decreasing water availability leads to ecosystems adapted to arid conditions when decreasing temperature as we move from low latitudes to high latitudes
    - Transition from warm adapted plants to cold adapted plants
- Link between temperature, water availability, and ecosystem composition is an example of the **law of limiting factors**
    - Limits the growth of an organism
    - Typically it is an abiotic or nonliving factor
    - For each factor, it is possible to define an optimum and limit of tolerance for each species
        - Species cannot exist outside their limits of tolerance for any one factor
