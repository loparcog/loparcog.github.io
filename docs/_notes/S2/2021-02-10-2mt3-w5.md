Music Therapy in Dementia Care and Precomposed Music
===

What is Ageing?
- To date, there exists **no normative** established values of what cognitive impairment or memory loss, or what neurochemical and neurophysiological changes accompany normal ageing
- Complex developmental process that involves the intersection of physical, phycological and social factors
- Older adults is currently the fastest growing population
- There is increased longevity in today's culture, from changing factors like:
    - War (much less so)
    - Tobacco (understanding of health risks and avoidance)
    - Life-styles (more understanding on healthy lifestyle choices)
    - Health care (and therefore increased elder care)

Definitions of Age
- **Chronological Age**: The number of years someone has been living
    - Our familiar way of measuring age
- **Biological Age**: On going *physical* process (birth to death)
    - Wrinkles, gray hairs, loss of stamina, bone density, etc.
- **Psychological Age**
    - Ability to respond to a changing environment and adapt to new situations
    - Learning/emotions (eg. computers, smartphones)
    - Insisting on writing and storing everything on paper
- **Psychosocial Age**: Cultural views and expectations
    - Can depend on what generation someone was brought up in, and how they adjust over time

Example Video: Betty White
- Example on how there are no normative values on ages
    - Psychosocial age is the same as when she was in her 20's, 30's, etc.
    - Biological age has increased semi-regularly, but would you be able to guess age by a picture?
    - Psychological age seems to all be there, still doing movies and such

Portrayal in Western Culture
- Negative portrayal of elderly
- Hide old people in retirement homes/LTCs - they have nothing to contribute
- Booming cosmetic industry, to hide signs of biological ageing
- Non-western cultures hold old people to high regard, looked up to for their wisdom

Music Therapy and Ageing
- All people age differently, we need to take into account all influences
    - Do assessments to see psychosocial age, what their issues might be, etc., to make the proper treatment plan
- Sample video of music therapy in a long term care facility

Dementia Definition
- An acquired decline of cognitive function represented by **memory and language impairment**
    - Just because you're ageing doesn't mean you will have dementia, big difference
- Difficult to diagnose, many different types and diagnoses within this umbrella
    - What is "normal" degeneration vs. an illness like Alzheimer's?
    - Masked by depression (can also cause cognitive and behavioural disorders, depression common in elderly)
    - Estimated that 20-30% will have an accompanying depression
- Main tool to diagnose dementia is the **mini mental state exam (MMSE)**
    - Brief cognitive test (Folstein, Folstein & McHugh 1975)
    - Widely used even today, "gold standard"
    - Results can vary based on education/english second language 

Dementia Symptom Care
- Progressive deterioration
    - No opportunity for rehabilitation
    - Goals should be around managing symptoms and enhancing aspects of well being, essentially give a "relief"
- Music abilities preserved - uses both hemispheres of the brain
- Musicality and singing rarely tested as features of cognitive deterioration
- Listening to story vs music (in reading), one case study with an 81yr old
    - Reduce wandering (stay seated), expanded upon by Groene (1993)
- Attempting music playing can highlight deterioration
    - MT needs to be mindful of clients who were musicians

Dementia and Health Care
- Cost of institutional care in USA over $25 billion/year (Steg 1990)
- Estimates suggest 15% of people over 65yrs will have moderate dementia
- Need for treatment initiatives
- Due to advancements in optical microscope, 1907 (Alzheimer) able to see the neuronal degeneration and senile plaques on the brain - identifying the disease

Dementia
- Common diagnosis associated with ageing (but not a result of ageing)
- Depression also associated with age
- Also deals with Alzheimers and Parkinsons (progressive)

Reasons for Referral
- *Likes music? Good/gifted at music? Responds to music? Was in a chair? Just having dementia?*
- Decrease pacing, agitation, vocalizations
- Increase eye contact, meaningful moments
- Increases alertness, movement
- Evoke positive memories, orientation to the "here and now"
- Transition to facility, lessen confusion, decrease anxiety

Research into Outcomes of MT
- Most published work re: MT and elderly (group MT)
    - Enhance socialization and communication (reduce isolation)
    - Muscular stimulation /fine and gross motor skills
- (1990, Clair) as per reading: 15 months of MT
    - Deterioration continued in all areas
    - Yet still able to participate in music activities
    - Interacted with one another, remain seated
- An example of group MT in LTC is something like "Saints Go Marching In"
    - Its repetitive lyrics makes things easier to process
    - Precomposed music is also good since it has a predictable structure
    - Give some form of "success", for someone who is forgetting many things, being able to get a song down supports them

Pre-composed Music
- Why is it such a powerful tool?
    - Can evoke memories, many life events connected to music
- Class example: listen to a song in class and list memories evoked
    - Evoking not just memories, but also opinions/thoughts

Entertainment vs Music Therapy
- "Isn't this a sing-along?"
    - Staff could walk by and assume a sing-along is taking place, a recreation tool rather than a therapeutic one
- What makes it MT?
- Familiarity/predictable music (ABA) - Que Serra Serra
    - ABA with A being a verse, B being a chorus
- Secure, empowering, reassurance, confidence, memory-evoking
- Stimulate dialogue/relationships (example of italian song and neighbours finding eachother through it in a LTC)

MT Interventions
- Singing
- Improvisation
- Playing instruments (eg. bell choir)
    - Prof explained bell choir seemed off in the beginning, but all in the group get a bell or chime or such, and would adapt to learning the music based on learning abilities and MT aided in keeping things together
    - Would keep people interested and involved, empowering to work together towards performances
    - Could also do activities like pointing to people to play their bells and get people to guess the song being played
        - Also gets a feeling of accomplishment for being able to play this song
        - People knew when it was their turn to come in after some practice
- Song writing

iPod Project
- Not music therapy, but important for understanding music as a tool in health care
    - Not music therapy since no music therapy is needed to facilitate it, no referral/assessment, etc.
