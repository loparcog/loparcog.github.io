Module 2: Earth's Atmosphere (Composition and Structure)
===

Chemical Composition of the Atmosphere
- Radiant energy from the sun energizes the atmosphere, driving day-to-day weather
- Earths atmosphere is a thin gaseous layer composed mostly of:
    - **Nitrogen ($N_2$)**, at 78%
    - **Oxygen ($O_2$)**, at 21%
    - Remaining 1% contains small/trace amounts of water vapour, argon, and carbon dioxide
- Many of the gasses have cycles of production called **sources** and removal called **sinks**
    - Composition of air for several gasses is a dynamic process
- 99% of the atmosphere lies within 30km of the earth's surface
    - Total masses of the gasses remains constant, but constantly going through cycles of destruction and production
- Composition of the atmosphere can be distinguished between radiatively and chemically **inactive** gasses and radiatively and chemically **active** gasses (ex. gasses that get transformed into chemical reactions or react when exposed to radiation)
    - Nitrogen does not easily react with other substances, so we can think of it as a mainly neutral substance
        - Nitrogen also considered a **permanent/constant** gas, since its concentration is nearly constant throughout the atmosphere, and has not changed much over recent history
- At earth's surface, there is a balance between destruction/output and production/input of $N_2$ and $O_2$ gasses
    - Ex. $N_2$ removed from the atmosphere primarily by biological processes with soil bacteria/ocean plankton, and is returned mainly through decaying plant/animal matter
- Argon is another radiatively and chemically inactive gas
    - Accounts for just under 1% of the composition of the surface atmosphere, therefore referred to as a **trace gas**
- Oxygen also considered a permanent gas, but is very reactive, easily combining with other substances through **oxidation**
    - Oxygen has two main sources in the atmosphere:
        1. Photosynthesis, where plants combine $CO_2$ and water to produce sugar with sunlight
        2. Ultraviolet radiation, breaking down water and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere
    - Oxygen is removed from the atmosphere through respiration by plant/animals, weathering of decaying plants/animals, and growth of shellfish
- **Variable Gasses** are gasses who's concentration vary greatly from place to place and from time to time
    - Water vapor is invisible and one of the most abundant variable gasses, as it gets added/removed from the atmosphere through the **hydrologic cycle**
    - Concentrations exist from nearly 0% over desert/polar regions, to nearly 4% near tropical regions
    - Water vapor is a contributor to earth's energy balance and many important atmospheric processes
    - Water vapor distributed much more broadly than just clouds
- **Carbon Dioxide Gas ($CO_2$)** is a small but important naturally occurring component of earth's air
    - Like water vapor, it traps a portion of Earth's outgoing radiant energy
    - $CO_2$ enters the atmosphere mainly through decaying vegetation, but also from volcanic eruptions, exhaling animals, burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), and deforestation
    - $CO_2$ is removed from the atmosphere during photosynthesis as plants consume $CO_2$ to transform into carbon stored in their roots, branches, and leaves
        - Oceans also act as huge reservoirs of $CO_2$, as phytoplankton (tiny drifting water plants) fix $CO_2$ into their organic tissues
        - $CO_2$ that dissolves directly into surface water mixes downwards and circulates through to greater depths
            - Current estimates guess the ocean holds more than 50x the total atmospheric $CO_2$
**Methane** is another variable gas, but its concentration has been increasing in recent history
    - Released to the atmosphere through fossil fuel activities, livestock digestion, and agriculture cultivation
        - Most derives from the breakdown of plant material by certain bacteria and rice patties, wet oxygen-poor soil, the biological activity of termites, and biochemical reactions in the stomachs of cows
    - A very effective absorber of terrestrial radiation, and it plays an active role in near surface warming
- **Aerosols** are any solid and/or liquid particle other than water which exists in the atmosphere, and is synonymous with the term *particulate*
    - Can come in different forms (dust from the desert, sea spray, natural combustion, human-made products)
    - Due to their small size, they can easily remain in suspension for long periods of time
    - Contribute to precipitation processes, acting as *condensation nuclei*
    - Breaking waves and bursting foam bubbles add salt particles to the atmosphere
    - Incomplete burning of fossil fuels, especially coal, releases some particulates and other aerosols
    - Smoke from wildfires can rise to several thousands of meters in altitude
    - **Overall**, aerosols decrease the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface, as they can scatter/absorb sunlight, and make clouds more reflective

Thermal Structure of the Atmosphere
- In the lower atmosphere, temperature drops with altitude (higher is colder)
    - Trend continues 12-15km above the earths surface
    - This rate of decrease is called the **Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR)**, expressed in degrees celsius per 1000m, and varies with atmospheric conditions
        - Average mid latitude lapse rate is $6.4^{\circ}$C/1000m
- Importance of ELR can be seen in dramatic change in vegetation moving up a mountain
    - Base of the mountain has lush and green vegetation
    - Higher altitude has sparser, smaller vegetation
    - Towards the top, vegetation becomes very sparse, mainly consisting of small bushes and grasses
    - At the very top, vegetation disappears altogether
        - Partially due to a change in temperature along the mountain's slope (warmer base, cooler peak)
    - When temperature is too cold for vegetation to survive, we call this altitude the **treeline**
- Earth's middle latitudes' average temperature profile shows four distinct layers of the atmosphere from identifiable temperature regions, changing with height:
    1. **Troposphere**
        - Lowest and thinnest of the layers, but contains 80% of atmosphere's mass
        - Named troposphere since it promotes atmospheric overturning, and is the region where virtually all weather processes occur
        - Warmed at the earth's surface by solar radiation, and identified by a steady temperature decrease with elevation
        - Top of the troposphere is where the temperature stops cooling, called the **tropopause**
        - Boundary between troposphere and stratosphere is roughly 16km thick over the tropics, but only 8km think over the poles (due to thermal expansion)
    2. **Stratosphere**
        - Area of little weather, where temperature increases with elevation
            - Temperature inversion caused by the absorption of UV radiation by ozone
        - Level of max ozone concentration in the stratosphere is observed near 25km, yet the air temperature maxes out near 50km
            - Occurs because ozone absorbs only certain wavelengths of UV radiation from the sun. Even though there are fewer ozone molecules higher up, much of the energy responsible for heating up the stratosphere is absorbed in the upper part of this layer, removing it before it can reach the lower, higher concentrated layers
        - Low air density and "layer stratification" makes the energy transfer from the upper to lower stratosphere quite slow
    3. **Mesosphere**
        - Characterized by decreasing temperatures with increasing height
            - Coldest atmospheric layer
            - Decrease of temperature caused by minimal ozone to absorb solar radiation
                - Molecules near the top of the mesosphere absorb less energy than those near the bottom
        - At the top (~85km), the atmosphere reaches it's lowest average value of $-90^{\circ}$C
    4. **Thermosphere**  
        - Uppermost layer of the atmosphere, slowly merging with interplanetary space, characterized with increasing temperatures with height
            - Temperatures approach $1500^{\circ}$C, but this is only a measure of the kinetic energy of the molecules in this layer
                - There is a very sparse amount of molecules so they produce little actual heat
        - Combined with the mesosphere, the two layers account for **0.1%** of total atmospheric mass
    5. Ionosphere
        - Not *really* a layer, but rather an electrified region within the upper atmosphere, where fairly large concentrations of ions and free electrons exist
            - Ions are atoms and molecules that have lost/gained one electron
            - Loss of electrons and positive charge when an atom cannot absorb all energy transferred to them by a colliding energetic particle or from the sun's energy
        - Interactions between the ionosphere and subatomic particles emitted from the sun excite atmospheric gasses, causing the **Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights)**
        - Can also cause communication disruption, particularly for AM radio comms

Module 3: Atmospheric Pollution and Ozone
===

The Major Air Pollutants
- **Pollution** is the human caused addition of any material or heat energy in amounts that cause undesired alterations to the environment, and is the byproduct of economic and social activity
- An **Air Pollutant** is a gas, aerosol, or particulate added to the atmosphere that can have harmful effects on humans, the climate, or the environment 
    - Three factors determine the level of air pollution:
        1. The amount of pollutants entering the air
        2. The amount of space into which the pollutants are dispersed
        3. The mechanisms that remove the pollutants from the air
- **Primary Pollutants** are the direct products of either combustion or evaporation, and are harmful to the environment in general, more specifically to humans
    - When emitted into the troposphere, they can be in a form that is directly harmful, or react to form other harmful substances
    - Primary air pollutants can have natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, burning of vegetation (a source of carbon monoxide), or dust stoms (carrying dirt and fungal/bacterial spores)
- **Secondary Pollutants** are the products of the interaction of primary pollutants with constituents of the atmosphere and light from the sun
    - Include chemicals like nitric acid ($HNO_3$, byproduct of $NO_2 + H_2O$), peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs, $NO_2 + O + HC$), formaldehyde and other aldehydes ($HC + O$), and ground-level ozone ($O_3$, from $O_2 + O$)
    - Can also have harmful effects to the environment and human health
- Several types of stationary sources of air pollution, which have relatively fixed locations
    - A **point source** is one controllable site, an example being a smokestack
    - **Fugitive sources** are open areas exposed to wind action (eg. as a result of land clearing)
    - **Area sources** are well defined areas within which there are several sources of air pollutants (eg. small urban communities)
    - **Mobile sources** move from place to place while emitting pollutants (eg. cars/trucks)
        - Airplanes, ships, and trains are also considered mobile sources
- The major atmospheric pollutants come from various sources...
    - **Sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$)**, a pollutant leading to the acidification of the atmosphere, is released primarily through fuel combustion, and to eliminate extent by various industrial processes and transportation
    - As well as being a greenhouse gas, **nitrogen oxides ($NO_X$)** can also lead to the acidification of the atmosphere, and is released primarily through fuel combustion and transportation
    - **Volatile organic compounds (VOC)** are organic chemicals that have a low boiling point, causing their molecules to evaporate and enter the surrounding air (eg. benzene, methylene chloride, and perchloroethylene, all associated with impacts on human health)
        - Released in the atmosphere by various industrial process and by transportation

The Ozone Hole
- **Ozone ($O_3$)** is the triatomic form of oxygen, essential to life on earth
    - Majority of atmospheric ozone, ~97%, is found in the stratosphere, approximately 14-50km above the earth's surface, where it forms naturally as oxygen atoms combine with oxygen molecules
        - Ozone concentration averages less than 0.002% by volume
    - Although small quantity, important to shield plants, animals, and humans from the suns harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays
    - UV radiation is absorbed by $O_3$, causing it to split into $2 O_2$ and $O$, which can then reform into ozone
- **Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)** represent a group of greenhouse gasses that (until recently) had been increasing in concentration
    - At one time, was the most widely used propellants in spray cans/insulation sprays, and also used as refrigerants and metal solvents
    - Migrate from the surface into the upper atmosphere
    - When entering the stratosphere, UV radiation strikes a CFC molecule, releasing a $Cl$ atom, which attacks an $O_3$ molecule
    - This forms $O_2$ and chlorine monoxide ($ClO$)
    - $ClO$ then joins with oxygen to produce $O_2$ and $Cl$
    - This $Cl$ molecule is then free to attack another $O_3$, repeating the cycle and impacting ozone concentrations
- Because of the effect of CFCs, ozone concentration in the stratosphere has been decreasing in parts of the northern/southern hemispheres, particularly over Antarctica
- The reduction in stratospheric ozone levels over springtime Antarctica has plummeted at such an alarming rate that during September and October, there is an "ozone hole" over the region
    - The hole is larger than just the land mass of Antarctica
    - Total ozone is measured in **Dobson units (du)**, representing the physical thickness of the ozone layer if it was concentrated as pure ozone, then brought to the earth's surface
        - $500 du = 5mm$
    - A similar situation can occur over the Arctic during the northern hemisphere spring, but it is normally much less intense because the extreme cold temperatures that enhance ozone destruction do not normally occur in the Arctic
- Ozone destruction peaks over the southern hemisphere, and persists throughout the spring
    - It has been decreasing in size over time though, thanks to the banning of CFCs in the 1980's, replacing them with less damaging **hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCPCS)**
    - Ozone hole was greater than the area of North America in 2006, but decreased significantly in further years

Micro Lecture 2: The Importance of Climate and Weather
===

What is the Importance of Weather?
- Weather processes can lead to major catastrophes associated to loss of life (eg. Hurricane Katrina, >1k died due to flooding, mass property damage)
- Can not only impact life, but also economy, creating extensive and expensive damage requiring billions of dollars to fix
- Climate change has occurred across Earth's history, with interconnected processes
    - Timescales vary from annual, to decadal, centennial, millennial, or even over millions of years
    - For example, earth has been on a cooling trend for the past 3 million years, from a greenhouse climate to an icehouse climate
- One indication of climate change is temperature
- Weather processes are **short-term** events, whereas climate processes occur over **much longer periods of time**

What are the Impacts of Climate?
- Many processes we as humans care about correspond to the climate of a region (eg. types of crops available depend on moisture/temperature requirements)
- Other parts of the world can have partial or year-long droughts, preventing food growth and requiring other means of nutrition
- Climate/temperature will also impact how people dress day-to-day (bundle up, dress down)

How are Weather and Climate Related?
- Weather and climate are **interdependent**
    - Sustained changes in weather create climate change (eg. warming in March days are evidence to Spring)
- Climate-related natural catastrophes are going up over the years, with three possible causes:
    1. **Meteorological**: Storms
    2. **Hydrological**: Floods, landslides, avalanches
    3. **Climatological**: Extreme temperatures, droughts, forest fires
    - Extreme weather events have become more common in the past 30 years (eg. hurricanes, droughts)
- Severe weather may signify a fundamental change in climate
- The number of extreme weather events can vary year by year, the slow and relatively steady change can be observed and noted
- Linked to the rise of average temperature over time since the late 19th century

Micro Lecture 3: Ideal Gas Law and Atmospheric Pressure
===

What is the Relation between Atmospheric Pressure and Temperature?
- The air pressure of a surface is related to the number of molecules
    - When more air molecules are stuffed into a column or air, their mass increases and surface air pressure rises
    - When air is removed from the column, the surface pressure falls
    - As surfaces cool and heat, their molecules shrink and grow, respectively
- Pressure can also be increased by increasing temperature, increasing molecular motion
- **Ideal Gas Law**
    $$p = \rho R T$$  
    $p$: Pressure ($Pa$)  
    $\rho$: Air density ($kg/m^3$)  
    $R$: 287 ($J/kg * K$)
    $T$: $K$
    - Holding one variable constant simplifies the equation, commonly done with pressure
    - If temperature is held constant, **density increases as pressure increases**
    - If density is held constant, **temperature increases as pressure increases**
    - If pressure is held constant, **density decreases as temperature increases**
