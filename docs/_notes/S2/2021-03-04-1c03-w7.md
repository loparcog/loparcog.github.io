Module 11: Winds
===

Pressure Gradients and Maps
- **Wind** is air that is moving horizontally relative to the earth's surface
    - Vertical movement is **vertical winds**
    - Caused by the unequal heating of earth's atmosphere, creating a **pressure gradient**; the heated air rises and the surrounding air is sucked in under the rising air
    - Process is the same for global and local winds
- Winds result from horizontal differences in pressure in the atmosphere, as winds blow to equalize the imbalance
    - The **pressure gradient force** results from differences in pressure between regions
- The average surface pressure is **1013.2 hecto pascals**, and pressure usually varies from **980-1030 hecto pascals**
- Air moves from areas of higher pressure to lower pressure (high temp to low temp)
- On a constant height map, **isobars** bend and turn around areas of high and low pressure, represented by *H* and *L* on the map
    - Constant elevation maps are smooth to take into account high altitude stations and stations with small observation errors
- **Constant Height Maps** can be used to show variations in pressure at any altitude
    - Each map has isobars for that constant height level showing the variations in horizontal pressure
    - An average isobar at sea level would be 1000 hPa, at 3000m would be 700 hPa, and at 5600m would be 500 hPa
- **Constant Pressure Maps** show variations in altitude for a constant pressure (given in hPa)
    - Also known as upper level charts or isobaric charts
    - High altitudes for a given pressure correspond to higher than normal pressures at a given latitude and vice versa
    - High altitudes also correspond to high temperatures and low altitudes to low temperatures
- The pressure gradient force is caused by a difference in pressure over distance
    - Directed perpendicular to the isobars from high pressure to low pressure
    - A large change in pressure over a short distance is a **strong** pressure gradient, whereas a small change over a long distance is a **weak** one
    - This gradient is what causes wind to blow
- Pressure gradient forces cross isobars at right angles, going from high to low pressure
    - The more tightly packed the isobars are, the higher the PGF
    - A higher PGF leads to stronger winds

Windflow
- Wind direction and speed is influenced by the **Coriolis Effect**, which is the apparent force caused by earth's rotation
    - Important only for broad scale winds which travel >100 km a day
    - In the NH, the Coriolis effect pulls to thr right, and in the SH it pulls to the left
    - Apparent deflection of all moving objects, including water and air, is due to the rotation of the earth
    - Deviation from this effect is greatest at the poles and decreases to 0 at the equator
    - Force increases with the speed of the object, but it only changes direction and has no impact on speed
- The pressure gradient force is equal to the Coriolis force because there is no friction at high altitudes
    - Cause winds to move parallel to the isobars on a constant height map
- Above the level of friction caused by the ground surface, air initially at rest will accelerate until it flows parallel to the isobars at a steady speed with the PGF balanced by the Coriolis force
    - A wind blowing under these conditions is called **geostrophic**
    - As a result, the direction of motion is perpendicular to the forces involved (PGF pushing towards low pressure and Coriolis force towards high pressure)

Cyclones and Anti Cyclones
- **Upper Level Cyclones and Anti-Cyclones** are rotating air parcels which are generated by the centripetal force resulting from an imbalance between the PGF and the Coriolis force
    - Centripetal force is at a right angle to the winds and generates a flow of are that is constantly accelerating inwards
    - A cyclone is a center of low pressure, with a CCW rotation in the NH and CW rotation in the SH
    - When the Coriolis force is smaller than the PGF, the winds flow more slowly, called **sub geostrophic flow**
    - Near the equator, the Coriolis force is negligible and the flow is called **psychlostrophic**
- Because of the constant mismatch between PGF and the Coriolis force in upper level cyclones, the winds follow the isobars
- An **anti-cyclone** is a center of high pressure
    - It has a CW rotation in the NH and CCW in the SH (reverse from cyclone)
    - When the Coriolis force is greater than the PGF, the winds flow more quickly, called **subgeostrophic flow**
    - Center is high pressure
    - Wind also flows through isobars
- At the surface, wind direction is also influenced by the frictional force, therefore the three forces combine at the surface
    - The frictional force works directly against the wind and slows it down
    - This process occurs up to 1km above the ground surface within the planetary boundary layer
    - A slower wind is also associated with a weakened Coriolis force, resulting in a wind oriented towards low pressure in an angle to the right
- **Convergence** at the surface is created by air spinning into a cyclone
    - As the air comes together it rises near the center and divereges aloft
    - The rising air cools adiabatically, which may lead to precipitation
    - This is a slow process compared to the movement of surface winds
- **Divergence** at the surface is created by air spiralling out from an anti cyclone
    - As air diverges at the surface, the air aloft converges and sinks downward, pushing down onto the surface at the center
    - The sinking air warms adiabatically, making the formation of clouds unlikely
- The process of convergence and divergence linked in earth's atmosphere

Module 12: Atmospheric Circulation and Long Range Transport
===

Models of Atmospheric Circulation
- The **general circulation of the atmosphere** refers to the average atmospheric air flow, which is caused by the unequal heating of the earth surface
    - The actual winds vary considerably
    - General rule; warm air is transferred from the tropics to the polls, and cool air is transferred from the poles to the tropics
    - Average conditions help identify driving forces
- The **One-Cell Model** assumes that Earth is covered by a uniform water surface
    - The sun is always directly overhead at the equator and the earth does not rotate
    - The result is a huge thermal convection cell called the **Hadley cell**
- More realistically, the **Three-Cell Model** includes the earth's rotation, but still assumes there are no land surfaces
    - Results in a model of three cells with alternating belts of pressure and wind
    - The three cells from equator to poll are **Hadley, Ferrel and Polar** cells
    - The alternating belts begin with a low at the equator while alternating belts of wind begin with easterly winds just North and South of the equator
- **Hadley Cell** dominates latitudes from 0 to 30 degrees
    - Is key to understanding wind patterns on earth
    - Corresponds to the **doldrums**, which are characterized by warm air and light winds
    - The cell works in the following way:
        - Intense heating over the equator causes air to rise, creating a low pressure at the surface over the equator called the **Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)**
        - The high pressure aloft pushes air towards the poles
        - At 30 degrees North and South, the air sinks back to the surface, corresponding to the subtropical high pressure belts
        - Air then returns to the ITCZ through the tradewinds
        - Tradewinds from northeast and southeast are deflected by the coriolis forests
- Climate is strongly influenced by the location of the ITCZ, which is a permanent low in atmospheric pressure near the equator
- ITCZ can also impact global rainfall patterns
- In the summer in the NH, the ITCZ moves poleward and the subtropics get abundant rainfall
    - If in a given year the ITCZ does not move as far North as previous years, then some areas that used to receive rainfall may experience a deficit/drought
    - In december it moves back towards the equator and the subtropics are dry and have clear skies
- **Ferrell Cell** is the poleward side of the subtropic high pressure belts between latitudes of 30 and 60 degrees
    - The Coriolis force turns the diverging air and produces westerly winds called the **mid latitude westerlies**
    - The associated weather systems generally move from West to East
- **Polar Cells** are located over the poles and the cold air in these regions leads to high pressure conditions
    - Results in development of the **polar easterlies**, carrying cold are and are intermittent in the NH
- Diverging air drives the trades and westerlies
    - There are four persistant subtropical highs in the SH, and in the NH there are two (the Hawiian High in the Pacific and the Azores High in the Atlantic)
    - Subtropical highs intensify and grow in the summer because the conditions are initially cooler over the oceans
    - The easter side of the subtropical highs are dryer, while the western sides are wetter
- During winter in the NH, the land is cooler than the ocean because water has a higher heat capacity
    - Results in high pressure over land and low pressure over the ocean
    - North Pacific dominated by the Aleutian Low, whereas the North Atlantic is dominated by the Icelandic Low
    - Summer is opposite, with Hawiian and Azores high over the North Pacific and Atlantic, respectively
- In the SH, Antarctica is always cold; as a result, there is always high atmospheric pressure over it and low pressure over the seas around it
    - Because of the sharp contrast in pressure, winds in these seas are very strong
    - Winter in the SH has similar location of highs and lows

Jet Streams
- Moving from low to high latitudes, wind flow and pressure patterns are created by temperature and pressure gradients
    - Gradients fare less strong at lower altitudes and create west to east winds particularly at mid to high latitudes because of the Coriolis force
    - These upper westerlies occur from 30 degrees to the polar low, are strongest at 35-55 degrees North and South of the equator
    - Weak easterlies occur over the equator and the tropics
- The polar front is where warm air from the Ferrel cell meets cold air from the polar cell and where the polar jet occurs
    - Associated with a sharp vertical gradient in pressure
- A **jet stream** is a swiftly flowing current of air that flows in a *wavy* west to east direction
    - Although shown as continuous, in reality they are discontinuous with position varying from one day to the next
    - Jet streams are where pressure gradients are strongest, with winds in these regions reaching 400 km/h at 7-12 km of altitude
