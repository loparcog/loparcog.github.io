Wireshark
===

What is Wireshark?
- A network packet/protocol analyzer
    - A network packet analyzer will try to capture network packets and tries to display that packet data as detailed as possible
- One of the best open source packet analyzers
- Intended for...
    - Network admins to troubleshoot network problems
    - Network security engineers to examine security problems
    - Developers to debug protocol implementations
    - Use it to learn network protocol internals
- Wireshark is **not** an intrusion detection system, it does not manipulate packets on the network, only capture then
    - Won't detect backdoors or anything
- Works through copying all packets sent/received by PC, and give it to the packet analyzer

Wireshark Demo
- Double-click a given network to get specific on packets being sent/received
    - Assignment to capture packets and analyze protocol
- Different packet types have different colors to help specify
- Can filter from top to look for given packets, ex. http
    - Still capturing all, but just displaying HTTP packets
    - Can also filter more directly for things like `ip.src == 192.168.xx.xx || ip.dst == 130.113.xx.xx && http`
        - Not recommended to just look at HTTP, look at all protocol connections
- Can go directly to some link in your browser (ie. mcmaster.ca) and then check new packets to see what was sent and received
    - If it does not work, try a different browser
- Click a given packet for more information about it
    - Different sections are shown for each protocol below, and will highlight the section in the bits of the packet
