Full Network Example
===

A Day in the Life
- Connecting to the Internet
    - If connected wirelessly, the laptop needs to be first associated with an AP on campus
    - For passive association...
        - Scan beacons from APs
        - Association request/response message
    - Connecting laptop needs to get its own IP address, addr of first-hop router, addr of DNS server: use DHCP
        - DHCP request *encapsulated* in UDP, encapsulated in IP, encapsulated in 802.3 Ethernet
        - AP converts 802.11 frame to 802.3 frame
        - Ethernet frame broadcast (destination: FFFFFFFFFFFF) on LAN, received at router running DHCP server
        - Switch broadcasts the frame to all LAN segments
    - DHCP server formulates DHCP ACK containing client's IP address, IP addr of first-hop router for client, name and IP address of DNS server
        - Encapsulation at DHCP server, frame forwarded (switch learning) through LAN, demultiplexing at client
        - DHCP client receives DHCP ACK reply
    - **Client now has IP address, knows name and address of DNS server and IP address of its first-hop router**
- ARP (before DNS, before HTTP)
    - Before sending HTTP request, need IP address of `www.google.com`: DNS
        - DNS query created, encapsulated in UDP/IP/Ethernet. To send frame to router, need MAC address of router interface: ARP
        - ARP query broadcast, received by router, which replies with ARP reply giving MAC address of router interface
        - Client now knows MAC address of first hop router, so can now send frame containing DNS query
        - Client now knows MAC address of first hop router, so can now send frame containing DNS data
    - IP datagram containing DNS query forwarded via LAN switch from client to first hop router
    - IP datagram forwarded from campus network into cogeco network, routed to DNS server (tables created by RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and/or BGP routing protocols)
        - Demux'ed to DNS servers
    - DNS server replies to client with IP address of `www.google.com`
- TCP connection carrying HTTP
    - To send HTTP request, client first opens TCP socket to web server
    - TCP SYN segment (step 1 in 3-way handshake) inter-domain routed to web server
    - Web server responds with TCP SYNACK (step 2 in 3-way handshake)
    - TCP connection established!
- HTTP request/reply
    - HTTP request sent into TCP socket
    - IP datagram containing HTTP request routed to `www.google.com`
    - Web server responds with HTTP reply (containing web page)
    - IP datagram containing HTTP reply routed back to client

Network Security
===

What is Network Security?
- **Confidentiality**: Only sender, intended receiver should "understand" message contents
    - Sender **encrypts** message
    - Receiver **decrypts** message
    - Others cannot understand the message
    - The identities, timing or frequency should be secrets as well
- **Authentication**: Sender, receiver want to confirm identity of each other
- **Message Integrity**: Sender, receiver want to ensure message not altered (in transit or afterwards) without detection
- **Access and Availability**: Services must be accessible and available to users

Internet Security Threats
- **Mapping**: Before attacking, "case the joint" - find out what services are implemented on network
    - Use `ping` to determine what hosts have addresses on network
    - Port-scanning: try to establish TCP connection to each port in sequence (and see what happens)
    - `nmap(url)` is an example of a mapper; "network exploration and security auditing"
    - Countermeasures:
        - Record traffic entering network
        - Look for suspicious activity (IP addresses, ports being scanned sequentially/ho)
- **Packet Sniffing**
    - Broadcast media
    - Promiscuous NIC reads all packets passing by
    - Can read all unencrypted data (eg. passwords)
    - eg. *C* sniffs *B*'s packets
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ps.PNG)
    - Countermeasures:
        - Not many, very hard to detect
- **IP Spoofing**: Can generate "raw" IP packets directly from application, putting any value into IP source address field
    - Receiver cant tell if source is spoofed
    - eg. *C* pretends to be *B*  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ips.PNG)
    - Countermeasures:
        - **Ingress Filtering**: Routers should not forward outgoing packets with invalid source addresses (eg. datagram source address not in router's network)
        - Great, but ingress filtering cannot be mandated for all networks

Denial of Service (DOS)
- Huge problem in current internet
- General form
    - Prevent legitimate users from gaining service by overloading/crashing a server

DOS: Sync Attack
- Buggy implementations allow unfinished connections to eat all memory, leading to crash
- Better implementations limit the number of unfinished connections
    - Once limit reached, new SYNs are dropped
- Countermeasures:
    - **Filter out** flooded packets (eg. SYN) before reaching host: throw out good with bad
    - **Traceback** to source of floods (most likely an innocent, compromised machine)
