Intro to Deep Learning Cont.
===

Went through slides of last lecture content...

Training
- Residual:
    - Deonte the input points by $x^{[i]}$ (given)
    - Let  
        $$y(x^{[i]}) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \text{ or } \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
    - Suppose we have computed $W^{[2]}, W^{[3]}, W^{[4]}, b^{[2]}, b^{[3]}, b^{[4]}$ and evaluate $F(x^{[i]})$
        - Our residual is given as:  
        $$\vert \vert y (x^{[i]}) - F(x^{[i]})$$
- Cost Function: What is used to estimate success
    - Optimize parameters $W, b$ to minimize the cost function
- Classifying: Given the result from the model, classify the input as *A* or *B* depending on which vector value is highest
