Socket Programming
===

Basic Steps
- Server creates and binds the socket in a specific port, listening for any requests
- The client creates a socket and connects to where the server is listening, where the server will accept it's request
- The client will send/receive data for one another, continuing until close
- Example in video, a simple socket server in Python
    - Uses package `socket`
- Note two different functions:
    - `socket.send()` will send a number of bytes, and you will need to take care of managing how many are sent and if they are received correctly
    - `socket.sendall()` will send all bytes and manage if any error occurs

Example of a Simple Web Server
- Recall HTTP protocol
    - Application-layer protocol to manage message format
    - Data can be attached and managed here
- Requests are managed through threads, to make sure the server is always open for any new listening requests
- Also need to construct the entire HTTP message, including any header info
- Key source code also in tutorial slides
