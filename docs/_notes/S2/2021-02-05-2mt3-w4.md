Songwriting as a Music Therapy Intervention
===

Introduction to Song Writing
- Song writing provides a tangible product
    - Does not need any background in music creation/training/theory to take part in song writing
    - Can be a recording or on-paper form, either to share with others or hold onto themselves
- Songs can be used to communicate with loved ones
    - Ease barrier of how to share how someone is feeling
    - May be more palatable for the person receiving
- Reflection - motivation and encouragement
- Safe space-exploration - identifying and externalizing emotions
- Telling your stories

Songwriting as a Music Therapy Intervention
- What client groups might benefit from the intervention of song writing? What might be some reasons for referral?
    - Range of movement issues? Not really applicable for this, may make a song to move to but songwriting is secondhand there
    - Anxiety can use songwriting to facilitate finding what causes the anxiety and tools to cope with the anxiety
    - Group therapy can find benefits in this as well
    - Main goals are in **self-reflection** and **communication**, most often around mental health goals and self awareness
        - Always exceptions though!

Example Video of Song Writing
- Cancer patient named Tim songwriting in music therapy
    - Initially against but eased into the idea of music therapy
    - Helps to get through emotions and struggles of hospital life
- Song writing main music intervention in this video
    - Helpful for emotional journey while going through treatment for cancer
    - Was also instrument playing, possible to do songwriting without playing

Acquired Brain Injury (ABI)
- ABIs are complex injuries with a variety of symptoms and disabilities
- An ABI patient often deals with:
    - Loss
    - Emotional crisis
    - Adjustment
    - Rehabilitation
    - Identity
- Rehabilitation commonly long, change commonly slow
- Often experiences a "change of identity", going from something like an athlete or parent or something, but since whatever happened, they cannot identify themselves as that anymore
- Symptoms include limited ROM (range of motion), dexterity, and speech issues
- For this class, TBI (traumatic brain injury) and ABI will be used interchangeably
- Common themes in ABI song writing are (from study analyzing 82 song written by TBI patients, these were the most common themes, idea of study was to try and learn what the emotional journey was like for people with ABIs)
    - Isolation
    - Dependency
    - Helplessness
    - Body image
    - Anger
- How can ABI affect speech?
    - Aphasia: Cognitively aware of what one wants to say, but cannot find the words
    - Dyspraxia: Difficulty articulating speech
    - Music therapy and speech pathologies
        - Can still sing even with these issues, can sometimes bypass speaking issues

When Should Song Writing be Introduced?
- When will song writing be helpful?
    - Aid in articulation and expression, self-discovery
- Depends on the client
    - Client may not want this, not want to expose emotional vulnerabilities right away
- Tell them about the risks if they want to start right away

Song Writing Techniques
- **Brain Storming**: Thinking about themes and words
- **Fill in the Blanks**: Using a pre-existing song and changing up words
- **Song Parody**: Changing all the words but melody remains the same
- **Song Collage**: Using pieces of other songs and putting them together
- **Rhyming**: Making brainstormed themes and words to rhyme in a song
- Remember end goal is to satisfy the needs of the client, so there doesn't necessarily need to be rhythm or rhyme or anything to it, as long as the client is happy and expressing or finding what they want through the song
    - The music therapist is not there to facilitate the correct music theory, rather facilitate the process of expression through songwriting
- Client will direct the music therapist on how the song should sound (happy/sad tone, any instruments, temp, etc.)

Gracie Video Example
- 12 year old who needed spinal therapy
    - Worked with a music therapist for her mom to write songs for one another while separated since Gracie would need to go across to other hospitals for therapy
- Song writing used here as song parody from "I am woman hear me roar", purpose for mom to empower her daughter who will be going to surgery
    - Very powerful way for her daughter to receive this message
    - Not only hear it from her mom, but also musically supported form the MTA and other health care workers, bringing everyone together
- Looking to empower Gracie and elevate her mood
- Gracie is the recipient of the songwriting, the mom was not necessarily the client but was probably helpful for her as well as another tool to support her kids

Sam Courseware Example
- 19yrs old, brain injury through train injury, not sure but may have been attempting suicide
    - Living at hospital due to care he requires and daily rehab program he is in
    - As a result of the brain injury, his cognitive ability is not helping his insight, so he doesn't understand he needs to be in the hospital to get better
    - Because of this he's angry, he wants to go home, he doesn't want to engage in the rehab options/interventions available to him
    - Non-cooperative to any health care specialists, referred to music therapist to hopefully "reach" him and help him express himself, ultimately understanding himself more and helping others to understand him, hopefully leading him down a path of rehabilitation
    - Sam enjoyed heavy metal music, so music therapist suggested this as the melody which Sam was really engaged in
- Song example, was result of many sessions
    - Chose chords and mood to play the song
- Empowering to share message he wanted to share

Sallie Courseware Example
- 12yrs old, struck by a car
    - Physio and speech issues
    - Language impairments, memory impairments, impaired social judgement
    - Unmotivated to participate in most therapies (therefore referral to MT)
- MT was used here for self-expression
    - Loved the Spice Girls, ideas of song writing were motivating, lots of ideas and creativity
    - Mom assisted in sessions
    - Wanted to create a video recording
    - Asked to write a "going home" song prior to discharge, worked on this during her last sessions (song parody of "Stop Right Now" by Spice Girls)
    - Song spoke about family members, upcoming events, and desire to walk again
