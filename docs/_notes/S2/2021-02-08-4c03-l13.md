TCP
===

TCP Overview (RFCs: 793, 1122, 1323, 2018, 2581)
- **Point-to-point**: One sender, one receiver
- **Reliable, in-order byte stream**: No "message boundaries"
- **Pipelined**: TCP congestion and flow control set window size
- Send and receive buffers
- **Full duplex data**: Bi-directional data flow in same connection
    - **MSS**: Maximum segment size
- **Connection-oriented**: Handshaking (exchange of control msgs) initiates sender, receiver states before data exchange
- **Flow controlled**: Sender will not overwhelm receiver

TCP Segment Structure
- Header and payload shown here:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/tcps.PNG)
    - Each row is 4 bytes, so the total minimum header length (header w/o options) is 20 bytes, actual length depends on the Options sent
    - `Acknowledgement Number` used to mark any acknowledgement one side may be sending to the other, whereas `Sequence Number` is the bytes of actual application data being sent
    - `U, A, P, R, S, F` are all flags

TCP Segments
- TCP "Stream of Bytes" service
- TCP **segment**
    - No more than **Maximum segment size (MSS)** bytes
    - Segment sent when segment full (MSS) or "pushed" by application
- Ex: MSS = 100 bytes, data received from application

TCP Sequence Numbers, ACK
- **Sequence numbers**: Starting byte offset of data carried in the segment
- **ACKs** ("What Byte is Next"): Gives sequence number just beyond highest sequence number received **in order**
- Ex. Sequence number = 1001. Sender sends 500 bytes, so receiver acknowledges with ACK number...
    1. 501
    2. 1002
    3. 1500
    4. **1501**
    5. 1502
    - Current sequence goes from 1001 to 1500, so next will be 1501
- Next sequence to send by sender is...
    1. 1500
    2. 1501
    3. **1501**

Establishing Connection
- **Three-Way Handshake**
    - Each side notifies other of starting sequence number it will use for sending
    - Each side acknowledges other's sequence number
        - **SYN-ACK**: Acknowledge sequence number + 1
    - The third segment may piggyback some data

    - Called three-way handshake since three messages are involved

    - Diagram transitions shown as action on top and message below
    - HTTP is stateless so it doesn't need something like this, but TCP does
    - Important to differentiate from client to server
        - Client follows right path down, while server follows left

Tearing Down Connection
- Either side can initiate tear down
    - Send FIN signal
    - "I'm not going to send any more data"
- Other side can continue sending data
    - Half open communication
    - Must continue to acknowledge
- Acknowledge FIN
    - Acknowledge last sequence number + 1
