Computer Arithmetic II
===

Arithmetic Cont.
- For $x,y$ as real numbers, what would be the solution to $fe(xy)$?
    - This would come out to $fe(x)* fe(y) *(1 + \delta_1)$
        - Note $\delta_i \eq \epsilon$
    - This expands to:  
        $$x(1 + \delta_2) * y(1 + \delta_3) * (1 + \delta_1)$$  
    - Note that each delta is less than *u*, that is $| \delta_{1,2,3} | \leq u$
        - In double, $u \approx 10^{-6}$
    - Knowing this, the expansion would give us a term $1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3 + \delta_2 \delta_3$, but since we know that $\delta$ is extremely small, multiplying them together makes them even smaller, so we can negate them, leaving us with $1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3$
- Following all of the above, we would then end up with:  
    $$xy(1 + \delta_1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3)$$  
    $$= xy(1 + \delta)$$
    - Now how big is $\delta$?  
        $$ | \delta | = | \delta_1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3 | \leq 3 u$$
- What if we make things more complex? Let x, y, z be FP numbers, so $fl(x) = x$
- We would get the following equations for each of the following operations:  
    $$fl(z(x+y)) = fl(z) fl(x + y)(1 + \delta_1)$$  
    $$= z((fl(x) + fl(y))(1 + \delta_2))(1 + \delta_1)$$
    - Note that every expansion will bring its own delta term since $fl(x) = x(1 + \epsilon)$
- We can also look at a square root value like $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
    - If $x = ln(200), y = ln(100)$, this equation would give an overflow, so we would need to do a different form
    - We can use the following information:  
        $$M = max(|x|, |y|)$$  
        $$M \sqrt{1 + (y/M)^2}$$  
        $$y/M = ln(-100), (y/M)^2 = ln(-200)$$
    - Executing all of this would end up with an answer of 1 for the square root, leaving us with a final answer of *M*
    - This formula can also be done with *hypot*, a Matlab function

Cancellations
- Assume we have two variables, $x = 1.23456, y = 1.23411$, each with 6 digit decimal places
- The subtraction of these would leave us with 0.00045, and normalizing this would leave us with $4.50000 * 10^{-4}$
    - But what if the x and y values are not accurate? Becomes a problem when subtracting values close to one another
    - Depending on how far down the decimal line your accuracy goes, you may end up with no digits of accuracy, leading to **catastrophic cancellation**
        - In our case, if the 0.00056 and 0.00011 were not accurate, that would lead us to catastrophic cancellation
        - Commonly occurs with operations with similar numbers or very small changes
- Another example of this would be $sin(x + h), x = 1.2, h = 10^{-4}$
    - This would be very similar to sin(x), which would lead to some cancellation, especially when numbers truncate themselves into a scientific notation
- If we made $h = 10^{-1}$, this would then lead to a bigger difference, and would lead to less digits lost by cancellation
- This could also occur with very large numbers in situations like $\sqrt{x+1} - \sqrt{x}$
    - This could then be swapped to be  
        $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x+1}+{\sqrt{x}}}$$
    , which will get you a better answer
- This can also be seen in the quadratic formula, where if $b^2 \gt \gt 4ac$, you essentially end up with $-b + b$
- Can run into issues as well for $e^{-x}, x \gt 0$, you want to try to get the exponent positive to avoid any rounding errors:
    $$e^{-x} = \frac{1}{e^x}$$
