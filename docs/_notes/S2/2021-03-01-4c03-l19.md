Network Layer Cont.

IP Packets
- An IP datagram format is given as follows:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipdg.PNG)
    - Each row is 4 bytes
- How much overhead is there with TCP *minimally*?
    - 20 bytes of TCP
    - 20 bytes of IP
    - Total of **40 bytes** plus app layer overhead
- **Protocol** (8 bits): Identifies the higher-level protocol
    - Important for demultiplexing at receiving host
    - Most common examples are 6 for TCP, 17 for UDP
- **Checksum** (16 bits): Particular form of checksum over packet header
    - If not correct, router discards packets
    - Checksum recalculated at every router
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)** (8 bits): Decremented by 1 at each hop, packet discarded if it reaches 0

IPv4 Address Exhaustion
- Fewer and fewer public IP addresses are available due to 32-bit limit of IP
- One solution is to make IP larger to get more possible IPs
- Another point is some devices don't need a public IP address, usually utilizing a private IP address
    - Network translation can translate private into public and seems to be another solution

IPv6
- Initially motivated by address exhaustion
    - Address length **four** times as big (128 bits vs 32 bits)
- Additional motivation:
    - Header format helps speed processing/forwarding
        - Would ned both source and destination to be 128 bits though
    - Header changes to facilitate QoS
    - IPv6 datagram format
        - Fixed length 40 byte header
        - No fragmentation allowed
        - No checksum
- Example image of data with IPv6:

- Other changes from IPv4
    - Checksum: removed entirely to reduce processing time at each hop
    - Options: Allowed, but outside of header, indicated by "Next Header" field
    - ICMPv6: new version of ICMP
        - Additional message types (eg. Packet Too Big)
        - Multicast group management functions


Transition from IPv4 to IPv6
- Not all routes can be upgraded simultaneously
    - How will the network operate with mixed IPv4 and IPv6 routers?
- **Tunnelling**: IPv6 carried as payload in IPv4 daatgram among IPv4 routers

IPv4 Addressing Recap
- **IPv4 Address**: Unique 32-bit number associated with a host router interface
- Represented with the **dotted-quad** notation (eg. 200.23.16.5)
- **Classful Addressing**: Divide addresses into classes  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/cadd.PNG)
    - Class A originally for big organizations
    - Class D for multicast
    - Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255
    - 127.0.0.1 is the **loopback address**
    - Problem: Class C is too small and Class B is too big!

IP Addressing: CIDR
- **CIDR: Classless InterDomain Routing**
- Idea: Flexible division between prefix and host address
- Intention: Offer a better tradeoff between size of the routing table and efficient use of the IP address space
- Ex: Suppose a network has 90 computers; what is the most efficient # of bits for prefix part and host parts?
    - SOLN:  
    Allocate 7 bits for host address (since $2^6 \lt 90 \lt 2^7$)  
    Remaining $32-7=25$ bits as network prefix
    - eg. 233.1.1.0/27

IP Addressing: Private Addressing
- **Private Addresses**: Free to use internally
