MIDTERM NOTES
- **NO MATLAB**
- Will cover:
    - Floating point
    - Linear systems
    - Interpolation stuff
- Midterm from last year on Avenue, solutions unavailable
- Following tutorial/lecture you "should be OK"

Ex1: `a,b` are IEEE FP numbers
- $fl(a \dot b) = fl(b \dot a), \dot \in [+, *]$
- Is it true that $fl(0.5 * a) = fl(a/2)$?
    - It should be
- Furthermore $fl(a+b) = fl(b+a)$ is always true

Ex2: What about $fl(a+(b+c)) = fl((a+b)+c)$?
- This is NOT always true, has conditions which cause different values
    - Depends on what is added first, can cause some over/underflow of values which will change outcome

Ex3: $a \leq fl[(a+b)/2 ] \leq b, a \leq b$
- We know that if $x \leq y$, then $fl(x) \leq fl(y)$
- Furthermore, we have $2a \leq a + b \leq 2b$
    - This can be expanded to $a \leq fl(a+b)/2 \leq b$  
    $a \leq fl[(a+b)/2 ] \leq b$
    - We can take the 2 out since it is a binary number, so it doesn't change anything

Ex4: Suppose *x* is a real number, what is the error in...
- $x+x$?
    - Assume $fl(x) = x(1 + \epsilon), |\epsilon| \leq u$
    - We can now expand this to:  
    $$fl(x*x) = fl(x) * fl(x) * (1 + \epsilon_1)$$  
    $$= x^2 (1 + \epsilon)^2 (1 + \epsilon_1)$$  
    $$= x^2 (1 + 2 \epsilon + \epsilon^2) (1 + \epsilon_1)$$  
    $$\approx x^2 (1+2 \epsilon) (1 + \epsilon_1)$$  
    $$= x^2 (1 + 2\epsilon + \epsilon_1 + 2 \epsilon \epsilon_1)$$  
    $$= \approx x^2 (1 + 2 \epsilon + \epsilon_1)$$ 
    We can represent $2 \epsilon + \epsilon_1$ as $\gamma$
- $\sqrt{x}$?
    - Assume $fl(\sqrt{y}) = \sqrt{y}(1 + \gamma), \vert\gamma\vert \leq u$
    - Explained in lecture, did not catch it
