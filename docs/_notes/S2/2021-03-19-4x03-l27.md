Numerical Methods for IVPs for ODEs Cont.

Backwards Euler
- Operates similarly, but works by calculating $y(t_i)$ from $y(t_{i+1})$:  
    $$y(t_i) = y(t_{i+1}) - h y'(t_{i+1}) + \frac{h^2}2 y'(\zeta)$$  
    where $\zeta$ is the error term
    - This equation approximates to:  
        $$y_i = y_{i+1} - h f(t_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$$  
        which, likewise, can be  
        $$y_{i+1} = y_i + h f(t_i+1, y_{i+1})$$
    - In forwards Euler, this would look like:  
        $$y_{i+1} = y_i + h f(t_i, y_i)$$
- Why use it?
    - It is **implicit** (?)

Stability
- Forwards and backwards Euler need specific *h* values for different functions to keep it stable
    - Forward requires $h \ge 0.2$
