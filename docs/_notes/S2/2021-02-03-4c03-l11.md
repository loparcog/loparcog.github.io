Transport Layer Design
===

Recall...
- Design issues:
    - Where to put the functionality?
    - Efficiency; utilization of bandwidth resource (ie. sending a message 1000 times will ensure message is properly sent, but is highly inefficient)  
        **Utilization = (Maximum application data rate)/(Available bandwidth)**
        - We would like to see 100% utilization, but due to overhead and such, utilization will be much lower than 100%
- Error Detection
    - Problem: Detect bit errors in packets (frames)
    - Solution: Add extra bits to each packet
    - Techniques (different use case for each):
        - Parity check
        - Checksum
        - Other sophisticated coding schemes such as Reed-Solomon code

Error Detection
- **Parity Checking**: Add an extra bit to make the line have an odd/even number of 1's
    - If odd parity check, sum up bits mod 2
        - If zero, parity bit is 1, otherwise it is 0
    - If even parity check, sum up bits mod 1
        - If zero, parity bit is 0, otherwise it is 1
    - The **redundancy** calculation is the number of bits used in full divided by number of bits in the message
        - Eg. using one parity bit for a 7-bit message would be 8/7
        - Can also be looked at for parity messages as $(d+1)/d$
    - Does not have a lot of overhead and redundancy, easy to compute, however cannot detect even number of bit errors and cannot correct any errors
    - Can make it stronger through **two dimensional bit parity**, adding a byte on top of the messages already with parity bits
        - Can detect many more errors, and can even correct single bit errors
        - More redundancy though, for N bits in a message and M messages, redundancy is calculated by $(M+1)(N+1)/(MN)$
        - Values will always work **if using even parity**, can run into issues using odd parity
        - Not really used, checksum more common
- **Internet Checksum**: Send sum of messages and compare results
    - 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16-bit words in the content to be protected
        - Two's complement sum: Summing the numbers (with carries)
        - One's complement sum: Summing the numbers and adding the carry (or carries)
            - Wrap around any carriers to the first bit to keep the message 16-bits long
    - From the sender:
        - Treat contents to be protected as sequence of 16-bit integers
        - Checksum: Addition (1's complement sum) of segment contents
        - Sender puts checksum value into the checksum field
    - From the receiver:
        - Compute checksum of received data
        - Check if computed checksum equals checksum field value:
            - NO: Error detected
            - YES: No error detected, but an error could have occurred
    - **In UDP**, the checksum is computed using the payload and a "pseudo header" that contains some of the same information from the real IP header

Loss Detection
- Causes of packet losses:
    - Buffer overflow
    - Drop after error detection
- Detection methods:
    - At the "crime scene"
    - At the receiver
        - How do I know that I am supposed to get certain data?
- **Loss Recovery**
    - Once packet losses are detected, the source needs to be informed
        - Negative ACK (NACK): "Packet xx is missing" vs...
        - Positive ACK (PACK): "Packet xx is received" -- timeout
    - Source action
        - Should I proceed to transmit the next message w/o the knowledge of the reliable delivery of the current one?
    - Retransmission
        - Retransmit every unacked packet?
        - Selectively retransmit the lost packets only?
