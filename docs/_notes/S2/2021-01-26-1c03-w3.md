The Sun
- The earth receives energy from the sun, our nearest star at ~150 million km from Earth
- The sun is a *giant celestial furnace*, and has an extremely hot core with a temperature estimated to be near 15 million degrees celsius
    - Here, hydrogen nuclei, or protons, collide at such high speeds that the fuse together to form helium nuclei
    - During this reaction, a heavy hydrogen atom is formed as an "intermediate step"
- This thermonuclear process generates a massive amount of energy, which gradually works its way to the sun's outer luminescent surface, called the **photosphere**
    - Temperatures in the photosphere are much cooler than the core, generally near 5700 degrees celsius
- The energy transfer from the sun to Earth is called **radiant energy**, or **radiation**
    - It travels in the forms of waves, releasing energy when absorbed by an object
- Because these waves have magnetic and electrical properties, we call them **electromagnetic waves**
    - Electromagnetic waves do not need molecules to propagate them
    - In a vacuum, they travel at a constant speed of nearly 300 000 km/s, the **speed of light**
    - Each wave also has a **wavelength**, which is the distance measured along a wave from one crest to another
        - Wavelength determines the form of energy (eg. heat, light)
        - Wavelength represented by lambda, $\lambda$, and can range from 100m to $10^{-8}$m
    - Visible light is at $\lambda \approx 5 * 10^{-7}$m, or $0.5 \mu$m
        - $\mu$m represents a **micrometer**, equal to $10^{-6}$m, or one millionth of a meter
        - Visible light actually ranges from $400-750\mu$m, known as the **visible spectrum**
    - Longer waves have less energy than shorter waves
        - Can interpret waves by the amount of energy they carry, inverse to their wavelength, as a **photon**

Insolation
- The sun emits a constant flow of radiation, but only a fraction of this radiation reaches the earth's surface
- As the radiant energy travels through space, virtually nothing interferes with it until it reaches the atmosphere
    - At the top of the atmosphere, solar energy received on a surface perpendicular to the sun's rays appears to remain fairly constant at 1367 Watts per meters squared ($W/m^2$), a value called **the solar constant**
- When solar radiation enters the atmosphere, a number of interactions can take place; it can be:
    - Absorbed by particles/gasses such as $O_3$, and converted into **sensible heat**, thereby warming the air
    - Deflected/scattered in all directions (forwards, sideways, backwards, etc.) when it strikes small object such as air molecules, dust particles and clouds
        - The distribution of light in this manner is called **scattering**
        - When more of the light striking an object bounces backwards than forwards, the radiation is said to be **reflected**
- Air molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light, so they are more effective at scattering the shorter, blue wavelengths, than the larger, red wavelengths
    - When we look away from the direct beam of sunlight, blue light strikes our eyes from all directions, turning the sky blue
    - This preferential scattering of the shortest wavelengths by air molecules creating a blue sky is called **Rayleigh Scattering**
- Solar radiation that passes through the air unimpeded is called **transmitted radiation**, ultimately absorbed at the earth's surface
- **Insolation** is a term used to describe incoming solar radiation
    - The effect of the radiation transmitted varies because solar radiation is directly related to solar angle
    - Higher solar angles reduce beam spreading, which leads to warming
    - Therefore, **warming is more intense where the sun angle is highest**
    - Lower solar angles induce less intense warming, since the same energy is spread over a larger area
    - Therefore, **warming is less intense where the sun angle is lowest**
    - These properties vary on a daily and annual basis for a given area
- **Annual Insolation** is the average radiation total for a year, depending on the sun's angle and length of a day, both determined by latitude
    - In other words, the latitude of a location determines it's annual insolation
    - Insolation is **stronger** at low latitudes because the sun's rays strike the surface directly, leading to intense warming
    - Insolation is **weaker** at high altitudes because the sun's rays strike at an angle, distributing the head and leading to less intense warming
- Not all insolation reaches the earth's surface:
    - 6% reflected by the atmosphere
    - 7% reflected by the surface
    - 17% reflected by clouds
        - 30% total reflected
    - 23% absorbed by gasses/clouds
        - The earth then processes and transfers this energy back to space
    - 47% absorbed by surface (depends on conditions, can be up to 80% with clear skies or 10% with covered skies)
        - 70% total absorbed, heating up the earth's surface
- Sunlight can also be reflected from objects
    - Generally, reflection differs from scatting in that during the process of reflection, more light is sent backwards
    - **Albedo** is the percentage of shortwave radiation returning from a given surface compared to the amount of radiation initially striking it
        - Represents the reflectivity of a surface to shortwave radiation
        - On average, albedo of clouds is ~60%, with thick clouds having a higher albedo than thin
        - When solar energy strikes a surface covered with fresh snow, up to 95% of the sunlight may be reflected
            - Most energy in the visible/ultraviolet wavelengths
        - Pavement has an albedo of ~3%
        - Water surfaces reflect only a small amount of solar energy, with a smooth water surface averaging ~10% albedo through a day
            - Albedo highest when the sun is low on the horizon and the water is a little choppy

Latent and Sensible Heat
- The surplus of energy at the equator is transferred as **sensible and latent heat** to higher latitudes, in order to obtain a **balanced net radiation** 
- **Sensible heat** is a result of the kinetic energy of molecular motion; it is heat which is transferred by conduction from molecule to molecule or convection, as a fluid flows
    - Can be felt and it's temperature can be measured
    - Transfer of heat from molecule to molecule within a substance is called **conduction** (eg. heat transfer from the hot end of a metal pin to the cool end)
        - Heat always travels from warmer to colder regions, travelling faster the greater the temperature difference is
        - When materials can easily pass energy from one molecule to another, they are considered to be good conductors of heat (eg. air is an extremely poor conductor, which is why insulation has lots of air pockets)
        - Air is such a bad conductor that in calm weather, hot ground only heats a few mm of air above it
    - Air can carry energy rapidly from one region to another through the process of **convection**, a transfer of heat through a mass movement of fluid (water/air)
        - Takes place in liquids and gasses since they can move freely and create currents
    - Heat transfer ultimately occurs like a pot of water boiling on a stove
        - The burner warms the bottom of the pot by conduction
        - The warm pot warms the water in contact with it also through conduction
        - The warm water rises, setting up convection currents
        - The pot, water, and burner, are constantly emitting radiant energy in all directions
    - Convection happens naturally in the atmosphere on a warm sunny day
        - Certain areas absorb more/less heat from the sun than others, resulting in uneven heating of air near the earth's surface
        - Air molecules bounce off of the surface, gaining some extra energy through conduction
        - The heated air expands and becomes less dense and more buoyant than the surrounding cooler air, causing it to rise, transferring sensible heat upward
        - Cooler, heavier air flows towards the surface to replace the rising air, becoming heated itself and rising, creating a cycle
        - This vertical exchange of heat is called convection, and the rising air bubbles are known as **thermals**
        - The cycle makes **convective circulation**, or **thermal cell** in the atmosphere
- **Latent heat transfer** is very important for the transfer of energy over long distances in the earth's atmosphere
    - Water vapor is an invisible gas that becomes visible when it changes into larger liquid or solid particles
    - This process of transformation is known as a change of state, or a **phase change**
        - The energy required to change a substance from one phase to another is called **latent heat**
    - Because the more energetic, faster moving molecules escape most easily, the average motion of all the molecules left behind decreases, causing a lower temperature overall
        - Evaporation is therefore a cooling process
        - The energy could come from the water or the air as well, so those could also be cooled 
    - This energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules
    - The energy released when water vapor condenses to form liquid droplets is called **latent heat of condensation**
        - In this phase change, heat energy is actually *released* into the environment
        - Latent heat of _____ is used in any terms for the energy required for a state change

Micro Lecture 4: Equations and Radiation
===

Stefan-Boltzmann Equation
- Tells us that all things whose temperature is above 0K emits radiation
- The equation is:
    $$E = \sigma T^4$$
    - E: Rate of radiation emitted ($W/m^2$)
    - $\sigma$: Stefan-Boltzmann Constant ($5.67 * 10^{-8} W/(m^2 K^4)$)
    - T: Surface temperature ($K$)
- A small increase in temperature creates a large increase in radiation emitted
    - Hotter objects emit more radiation (eg. Sun @ 5800K vs Earth @ 288K surface temperature)

Blackbodies and Greybodies
- Any object that is a **perfect absorber** (absorbs all radiation that strikes it) and a **perfect emitter** (emits maximum amount of radiation for its given temperature) is called a **blackbody**
    - Since the earth's and the sun's surface emit with nearly 100% efficiency for their respective temperatures, they both behave as blackbodies
- Objects that do not emit and absorb the maximum radiation possible for their given temperatures are called **greybodies**
    - Emit/absorb only a fraction of the radiation of a blackbody
    - The fraction of energy a greybody emits/absorbs compared to a blackbody is called its **emissivity**
    - By definition, a blackbody has an emissivity of 1, and a greybody has a value less than 1
- We can modify the Stefan-Boltzmann law to account for the reduced emission by multiplying it with the object emissivity:
    $$E = \epsilon \sigma T^4$$  
    where $\epsilon$ is the emissivity factor of the object 
- Most solids (eg. tin foil) and liquids (eg. water) are grey bodies

Wien's Law
- Tells us at what wavelengths do the sun and earth radiate most of their energy
    - The sun and the earth both have characteristics which follow a relationship called Wien's Law, named after the German physicist who discovered it, Willem Wein
- The equation is:
    $$\lambda = c/T$$
    - $\lambda_{\max}$: Wavelength of maximum radiation intensity ($\mu m$)
    - T: Surface temperature ($K$)
    - c: Constant (2897 $\mu m * K$)
- Hotter objects emit at shorter wavelengths, and cooler objects emit at longer wavelengths
- The sun, with surface temperature ~5778K, emits at $\lambda_{\max} \approx 0.5\mu m$
- The cooler earth, at surface temperature ~288K, emits at $\lambda_{\max} \approx 10\mu m$
    - Sun not only radiates more energy than earth, but also radiates the majority of it's energy in shorter wavelengths, peaking in the visible realm
    - Earth's radiation is often called **long-wave radiation**, while the solar radiation is called **short-wave radiation** 
- Also shows that as the temperature of an object increases, the wavelength at which maximum emission occurs is shifted towards shorter values
    - For example, if the sun's surface temperature were to double to ~12000K, it's wavelength of maximum emission would be halved to $\approx 0.25 \mu m$
    - Same inverse relation would occur if the temperature halved, doubling the max emission wavelength

Solar and Terrestrial Radiation Spectra
- Substantial fraction of both earth and solar radiation are absorbed by components of the atmosphere
    - UV emitted by the sun is absorbed by ozone
    - Infrared radiation by Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide and water vapour
    - Long-wave radiation is mostly absorbed by carbon dioxide and water vapour

Kirchhoff's Law
- Objects that selectively absorb and emit radiation (eg. gases in atmosphere) are known as **selective absorbers**
    - Object that selectively absorb radiation also selectively emit radiation at the same wavelength
    - This phenomenon is called **Kirchhoff's Law**
- This law states that good absorbers are good emitters at a particular wavelength, and poor absorbers are poor emitters at the same wavelength
    - Both water vapor and carbon dioxide are strong absorbers of infrared radiation, and poor absorbers of visible, solar radiation
    - As these gases absorb infrared radiation emitted from earth's surface, they gain sensible heat, which is then emitted from the gas molecules in all directions as infrared radiation
        - A portion of this radiation goes back to earth and heats the ground
