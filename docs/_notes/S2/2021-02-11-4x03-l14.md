Numerical Integration: Basic Rules
===

Numerical Integration
- $f(x)$ is given, evaluate it numerically  
    $$I = \int_a^b f(x) dx$$
    - Goal of integration is to estimate the area under the curve made by $f(x)$ within the interval of $[a,b]$
- Three different ways of doing this traditionally, with *h* being each intervals
    1. **Trapezoidal Rule**: Draw a line from *a* to *h*, solve for the area of the trapezoid below
    2. **Midpoint Rule**: Get the value of the function at $f(a + (h/2))$, make a horizontal line at that point and solve for the rectangle created
    3. **Simpson's Rule**
- All of the above are $O(h^2)$ in complexity

Adaptive Quadrature
- Type of integration, instead of equal subintervals, make subintervals large when mainly no change happening and small when large change is happening
    - Helps to increase accuracy

Ex: $f(x) = \int_0^1 e^x dx$
- Function naturally curves upwards between 0 and 1
- Using trapezoidal rule...  
    $$I_{trap} = 1/2(e^0 + e^1) = 0.5(1 + e)$$  
    $$= 1.8591$$  
    $$\text{exact}= 1.7182$$  
    - This is a bit of an overshot
- What if we do trapezoidal with only [0,0.1]?
    - Error becomes much smaller, 0.10525 vs 0.10517
- Using midpoint rule...  
    $$I_{mid} = 1 + e^{0.5} = 1.6487$$
    - A bit less error with this since the first section overshoots while the last bit undershoots, a bit of a "balance"
- Using midpoint with only [0,0.1] gives us 0.10512, smaller error than trapezoidal
- Using integration with lagrange (intervals and weights)...   
    $$I_f = \int_a^b f(x) dx = \sum_{j=0}^n a_j f(x_j)$$  
    where $a_j$ is the coefficient weight
    - We are given $x_0, x_1, ..., x_n$ distinct points in [a,b], so we can then do  
    $$p_n(x) = \sum^n_{j=0} f(x_j) L_j(x)$$  
    $$f(x) \approx p_n(x)$$  
    Therefore, we can then use:  
    $$\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \int_a^b p_n(x) dx = \int_a^b \sum_{j=0}^n f(x_j) L_j(x) dx$$  
    $$= \sum_{j=0}^n f(x_j) \int_a^b L_j(x) dx$$  
    The final integral in this term is the function's $a_j$ value

Basic Rules
- For the trapezoidal rule, we want to approximate over a single given interval; $x_0 = a, x_1 = b$
    - We only have two points, so one subinterval, $n=1$
- This gives us the following:
    $$L_0(x) = \frac{x-x_1}{x_0 - x_1} = \frac{x-b}{a-b}$$  
    If we integrate this  
    $$\int_a^b \frac{x-b}{a-b} dx = \frac{b-a}2$$  
    Moving to L1,  
    $$L_1(x) = \frac{x-x_0}{x_1 - x_0} = \frac{x-a}{b-a}$$  
    - This then finishes and expands to  
    $$\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{b-a}2 (f(a) + f(b))$$
- To get the midpoint rule, we take $x_0 = (a+b)/2$, and from the last section, we get that as
    $$\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx (b-a)f(\frac{a+b}2)$$
- Finally, the Simpson rule has $n=2$, where $x_0 = a, x_1 = (a+b)/2, x_2 = b$, giving us  
    $$\int_a&b f(x) dx \approx \frac{b-a}6 \left[ f(x) + 4f \left(\frac{a+b}2 \right) + f(b) \right]
- Rules can be **composite** by the use of subintervals, and then applying the rules to each of those subintervals

Errors
- The errors for each are as follows:  
$$E(f) = \int_a^b f(x) dx$$  
$$\text{Trap: } E(f) = -\frac{f^n(n)}{12} (b-a)^3, n \in (a,b)$$  
$$\text{Midp: } E(f) = -\frac{f^n(\alpha)(b-a)^3}{24}, \alpha \in (a,b)$$  
$$\text{Simp: } E(f) = -\frac{f^n(\zeta)}{90} \left( \frac{b-a}2 \right), \zeta \in (a,b)$$
    - Simpson gives the lowest error
