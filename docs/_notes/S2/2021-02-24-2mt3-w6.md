Improvisation & ASD
===

Improvisation
- What is improvisation?
    - Which model or approach is likely to use improvisation?
    - Why would an MTA implement improvisation?

Free Improvisation and Playing Rules
- Can be intimidating to people with and without music training
    - How to facilitate?
- Number of playing rules to help with this
    - ie. playing only on black keys of the piano (sounds all sound good together, easy form of self expression or exploring improvisation)
- Technique of **Mirroring**
    - Empathetic, doing what the client is doing at the exact same time
        - Same key in some cases for things like one piano
    - Allows the client to see themselves in the therapist
- Technique of **Matching**
    - Empathetic
    - Validates client
    - Therapist creates music that is compatible with the clients (matches)
    - Same style and quality but not the exact same notes, concept of together yet separate
    - More like an accent on top of client, doesn't need to be same time either
- Technique of **Grounding**
    - Creating a musical anchor for the client
        - Done with a repetitive, predictable beat
    - "Ground the chaos", give some type of centeredness while still allowing client to be full in their expression
- Technique of **Holding**
    - Stronger pattern instead of grounding, helps to do some more guidance through chaos
    - Musical anchor and *container* (container is strong patterned music which provides a structure for musical chaos)
- Technique of **Dialoguing**
    - Musical conversation, form responses and make a sort of *back and forth* between therapist and client
- Interplay between all of these techniques can occur in a session
- Many can be involved in improv, just watch for someone who may not be too *grounded*, as the free chaos could further facilitate a disconnection, will need more grounding and holding
    - No background needed, commonly better without since trained musicians have habits to think of keys and natural transitions and such
- Outcomes of improv include
    - Facilitation of social skills and turn taking
    - Facilitate increased attention span
    - Enhance confidence, allow client to take more risks
    - Reduce anxiety

Music Therapy & ASD
- "Everyone is a genius, but if you just a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life thinking its stupid"
    - Many abilities those with autism have that neurotypical people do not
- What is **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**?
    - Autism is a pervasive developmental disability that affects a person's ability to communicate and interact with others
        - Music therapy focusses on strengths, not weaknesses, so like to focus on what makes someone strong other than what breaks them down
    - Seen as a spectrum, going from non-verbal, some with "behaviours", etc.
        - Very different for each person
- Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015
    - In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1-2 per 1000 worldwide
    - In developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD
- Autism is a very complex disorder
    - If you have met one person with autism, that's just it, very unique for each person
    - PDD, Rett's Syndrome, Asperger's
    - Not specific to socio-economic and cultural factors
    - MT & ASD - Amelia Oldfield
- Example video in slides
    - Would you be able to know that this child has autism?
    - When engaging in music, there is no way to know
- Symptoms
    - Deficits in communication and social skills
    - May display "behaviours"
    - Typically symptoms surface by age 3
        - Can't tell through birth or early age, no difference with a baby at that time
        - Even if symptoms come up before, no way to really tell so avoid diagnosing then
    - Diagnosis includes: impairment of reciprocal social interaction, verbal communication, and restricted repetoire of interests (may include stereotypical/repetitive movements)
- History
    - Leo Kanner (psychiatrist) introduced the label "Early Infantile Autism" in 1943
        - Reasoned that it occurred because mothers would not provide infants with the love/support they needed, and as a result they developed autism
- Causes
    - Unknown (genetic/environment)
    - No genetic markers found yet
    - "Refrigerator Mother" of Leo Kanner was debunked
- Rethinking ASD
    - Research is helping us to gain a better understanding of ASD, how to support people, and how to recognize abilities within a diagnosis such as ASD
    - Music can often highlight abilities
    - Many support and awareness groups advocating for people with ASD
        - Some people still stuck on not accepting and celebrating differences
- ASD and MT Interventions
    - Typically working towards **communication, social interactions, sensory processing, behavioural issues, and music therapy**
    - **PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System)** - collaborate with SLP
    - Music is flexible
    - Expressive and receptive language
    - Call and response; repetitive lyrics
    - Motivation/prompt interaction - successful tool for meaningful interactions
    - Helps to let people to be loud and "let loose", freely vocalize and make any behaviours without judgement or complaint from others, but actually get support from the MT
    - People on the spectrum commonly have heightened musical abilities, helps to build confidence and self esteem, work on communication by working through music
- Example video for Carley's experience
    - Essentially non-verbal but then was given a computer and could communicate
    - Shows need for a means of self expression
- Live Music
    - Allows MTs to interact and get reactions from the client
    - Very freeing, allows clients to feel heard
    - Music is not usually avoided by ASD patients
    - Sensory processing issues (heightened tough or hearing)
        - Music tends to not cause the same response of "overload" in clients, not a sound that is avoided but one that is invited in
    - Some clients have better than normal abilities in music
        - Some have perfect pitch
        - Can hear a piece and then play/sing it back, remembering notes and lyrics (usually with music training)
- Examples in courseware
    - Evan: Really loud voice, quite overpowering, other children don't know how to interact with him and vice versa
        - Working on musical about how blood circulates through body
        - Found in the end that with Evan's voice and academic excellence, he could read and memorize how blood circulates
        - Became narrator of the musical, doing all accurately by memory
        - Enabled other kids to see value in Evan, sees everyone can contribute when given an opportunity to use their strengths
    - Abdi: Used a special song to help facilitate learning
    - Essentially examples of MT in collaboration with teacher (eg. a "wait your turn song", appropriate personal space)
        - Structure and predictability is important!
    - Can do songs for communication (find a friend, look them in the eye, find a friend and now say hi!), others for bubbles, where to stand in relation with others, internalizing "bubble" spacing
- Predicting Change and Transition in a MT Setting
    - Having a predictable environment is important for handling anxiety
    - White board/schedules/visual cues
    - Predictable space
    - Eg. Hello/Movement song/Singing/Playing drums/Surprise or choice/Dice/Closing
    - Additional goals may include; academia, physical/motor, leisure
- Case Study: Amelia Oldfield
    - 5yr old boy with language disorder; not diagnosed with autism but lot of crossover and similarities
        - Jamie, only child, assessed at age 3 with a language disorder
        - History and background of client matter!
    - 2yrs of Group and Individual Music Therapy
- Music Therapy Assessment
    - Is music therapy useful for this client?
    - What would the treatment plan look like?
    - Abilities highlighted in music?
    - Suggest ways parents and teachers could use music with Jamie
- Outcome of Assessment
    - Focus on spontaneous communication through music and vocalizations (had not babbled/experimented with sound as a baby)
- Treatment Process (3 Phases over the course of 2yrs)
    - Phase 1
        - Wait list for 1:1 sessions, therefore joined group
        - Musical conversations between children
        - When conducting, Jamie started using more words
    - Phase 2
        - Individual sessions
        - Goals to increase communication, eye contact, vocalizations and spontaneity
        - After 6 months: greater willingness to communicate (at home and in school)
    - Phase 3
        - Goals to diminish "silly behaviours" he had more recently developed such as screaming/throwing objects and communication goals
        - After 4 months: Able to initiate and engage in conversations
