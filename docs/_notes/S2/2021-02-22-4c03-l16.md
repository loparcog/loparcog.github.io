TCP Congestion Control Mechanisms
===

Recall...
- TCP Congestion Control 
    - Congestion Detection
        - Loss event: timeout or 3 duplicate acks
        - TCP sender reduces rate (congestion window) after loss event
    - Rate adjustment (Probing)
        - Slow start
        - Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)
            - Looks like a saw wave of increasing and decreasing, never flatlining
            - Always adapting to behaviors
        - Conservative after timeout events
        - Utilizes packet loss events as evidence for congestion
    - Does packet loss equal congestion?

Congestion Window (`cwnd`)
- Limits how much data can be in transit
- Implemented in a number of bytes

    - Note that `rwnd` is the receive window, used for the purpose of flow control
    - Using `rwnd` and `cwnd`, we can effectively control the rate which data is sent

Self-Clocking
- If we have a large window, ACKs "self-clock" the data to the rate of the bottleneck link
- Observe: received ACK spacing is around equal to L/bottleneck bandwidth

Phases of TCP Congestion Control
- Congestion Window (`cwnd`): Initial value is 1 MSS (maximum segment size) counted in bytes
- Slow-start threshold value (`ss_thresh`): Initial value is the receive window size
- **Slow Start** (getting to equilibrium)
    - `cwnd` < `ss_thresh`
    - Want to find this very very fast, not waste any time
- **Congestion Avoidance**
    - `cwnd` >= `ss_thresh`
    - Probe the available bandwidth more gently
    - React to network conditions

TCP: Slow Start
- **Goal**: Discover *roughly* the proper sending rate quickly
- Whenever starting traffic on a new connection, or whenever increasing traffic after congestion (timeout) was experienced:
    - Initial `cwnd`= 1MSS
    - Each time a segment is acknowledged, increment `cwnd` by one MSS
- Continue until...
    - Reach `ss_thresh`
    - Packet loss
- Illustration:

    - The congestion window size grows very rapidly
    - TCP slows down the increase of `cwnd` when `cwnd` >= `ss_thresh`
- Observe:
    - Each ACK generates two packets
    - Slow start increases rate exponentially fast (doubled every RTT!)
