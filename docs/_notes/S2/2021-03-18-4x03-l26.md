Numerical Methods for IVPs (initial value problems) for ODEs (ordinary differential equations)
===

Equations
- We would like to solve for *y*, where:  
    $$y' = f(t, y)$$  
    $$y' = \frac{d}{dt} y(t)$$  
    $$y(a) = c$$
    - $y(a)$ is our initial condition
- Ex: Take the formula $y' = -y + t$
    - We can calculate this as:  
        $$y(t) = t - 1 + \alpha e^{-t}$$  
        where $\alpha$ is a constant
    - We then get:  
        $$y'(t) = 1 - \alpha e^{-t}$$  
        $$= -y + t$$
    - Given the following initial condition,  
        $$y(0) = 5$$  
        we can get  
        $$y(0) = -1 + \alpha e^{-0} = -1 + \alpha = 5$$  
        $$\alpha = 6$$
    - This value can be different for different initial conditions
    - Use these values to estimate other values in the function
- There are explicit and implicit methods (mainly going step to step)
- There are also single step and multistep (use one/many points to compute another point, considered using current point or current and previous points)
    - Single step methods include Ruuge-Kutta, Taylor Series
    - Multistep methods include Predictor-corrector, BDF
- Roughly speaking, if we have a function with rapidly changing phase (ie. $e^x$)...
    - **Nonstiff methods** would use very small steps to get accurate data, but then would keep taking small steps, making it take a long time to reach far data
    - **Stiff methods** however can vary their step size once they reach a relatively unchanging piece of the function, allowing for accuracy when needed and fast computation when possible

Euler's Method
- A particular case of Taylor Series (order 1)
- We have the same base functions:  
    $$y'(t) = f(t, y)$$  
    $$y(0) = y_0$$
- Now we split into subintervals:  
    $$h = \frac{t_{end}}N, N \text{ subintervals}$$
- We can then write the formula for $t_{i+1}$:  
    $$y(t_{i+1}) \approx y(t_i) + h y'(t_i)$$  
    $$= y(t_i) + h f(t_i, y(t_i))$$
- We can also build the equations...  
    $$y_{i+1} = y_i + hf(t_i, y_i)$$  
- Say we have  
    $$y' = -y + t = f$$  
    $$h = 0.1, y(0) = y_0 = 5$$  
    Then we can get:  
    $$y_1 = y_0 + h f(t_0, y_0)$$  
    $$= y_0 + h(-y_0 + t_0)$$  
    $$= 5 + 0.,1(-5) = 4.5$$
    - We can continue on for any next step
