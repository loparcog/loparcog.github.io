Computer Arithmetic
===

Floating-Point Number System
- A **floating-point (FP)** system is charictarized by four integers $(\beta, t, L, U)$, where...
    - $\beta$ is the base of the system or radix
    - $t$ is the number of digits or precision
    - $[L, U]$ is the exponent range
- A number $x$ in the system is represented as:  
$$x = \pm \left( d_0 + \frac{d_1}{\beta} + \frac{d_2}{\beta^2} + ... + \frac{d_{t-1}}{\beta_{t-1}} \right)$$
- The string of base $\beta$ digits $d_0 d_1 ... d_{t-1}$ is called the **mantissa/significand**
    - $d_1 d_2 ... d_{t-1}$ is called **fraction$$
    - A common way of expressing $x$ is:  
    $$ \pm d_0 d_1 ... d_{t-1} * \beta^e$$
- A FP number is **normalized** if $d_0$ is nonzero, otherwise it is **denormalized**
- Ex: Consider the FP (10, 3, -2, 2)
    - Numbers are of the form:  
    $$d_0 . d_1 d_2 * 10^{e}, d_0 \neq 0, e \in [-2, 2]$$
    - Largest positive number is $9.99 * 10^2$
    - Smallest positive normalized number is $1.00 * 10^{-2}$
    - Smallest positive denormalized number is $0.01 * 10^{-2}$
    - 0 is represented as $0.00 * 10^0$

Rounding
- How to store a real number  
$$x = \pm d_0 . d_1 ... d_{t-1} d_t d_{t+1} ... * \beta^e$$  
in *t* digits?
- Denote by $fl(x)$, the FP representation of *x*
    - Rounding by **chopping** (called rounding towards 0)
        - Essentially flooring if positive and ceiling if negative
    - Rounding to **nearest** ($fl(x)$ is the nearest FP to *x*, if a tie, round to the even FP)
        - General rounding rules, just not round up at .5 but round to nearest
    - Rounding **towards $+ \infty$** ($fl(x)$ is the smallest FP $\geq$ *x*)
        - Always ceiling
    - Rounding **towards $- \infty$** ($fl(x)$ is the largest FP $\leq$ *x*)
        - Always floor
- **Machine Epsilon**: The distance from 1 to the next larger FP number
    - Eg. in (10, 3, -2, 2), $\epsilon_{mach} = 1.01 - 1 = 0.01 = 10^{-2}$
    - Another definition: smallest $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that $fl(1 + \epsilon) \gt 1$
        - NOTE: These two definitions are **not equivalent**
- **Unit Roundoff**: $u = \epsilon_{mach}/2$ when rounding to the nearest $fl(x) = x(1 + \epsilon)$ where $|\epsilon| \leq u$

IEEE 754
- IEEE 754 is the standard for FP arithmetic, started in 1985
    - There is also a 2008 and 2019 revision, looking to update every 10 years but may reduce to 5
- Most common (binary) single and double precision since 2008 half precision

- `Inf, -Inf` when the result overflows (eg. 1/0)$
- `NaN` "Not a Number" results from undefined operation (eg. 0/0, 0*Inf, Inf/Inf)
    - NaNs typically propagate through computations
- Consists of sign (1 bit), exponent (8/11 bits), and mantissa (23/52 bits) depending on 32/64 bit storage
    - Sign is 0 if positive and 1 if negative
    - Exponent is biased
    - First bit of mantissa is not stored, it is a "sticky bit" and assumed to be 1
- Single precision
    - `Inf`: Sign 0/1 for positive/negative infinity, biased exponent is all 1's, 255, fraction is all 0's
    - `NaN`: Sign is 0/1, biased exponent is all 1's, 255, and fraction is at least one 1
    - 0: Sign is 0/1 for positive/negative, biased exponent and mantissa is all 0's
    - FP Numbers: Biased exponent from 1 to 254, bias is 127, actual exponent is 1-127 = -256 to 254 - 127 = 127
- Double precision
    - Bias is 1023
    - Biased exponent is from 1 to 2046
    - Actual exponent is from -1022 to 1023
    - Rest similar to single
