Principles of Network Applications
===

Application Layer
- Services: Supporting network applications
    - Protocols: FTP, SMTP, HTTP, HTTP, SIP, RTP, RTSP
    - Applications: File transfer, email, web browser, skype, media streaming, etc.
- Uses **socket interfaces** from the transport layer (TCP & UDP)
- Architectures: 
    - **Client-Server**
        - **Server**: Always-on host, permanent IP address, data centers for scaling
        - **Clients**: Communicate with server, may be intermittently connected, may have dynamic IP addresses, **do not communicate directly with each other**
    - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**
        - No always-on server
        - Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
        - Peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
            - **Self scalability** -  new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
        - Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
            - Complex management
    - **Hybrid**   
        - Servers provide account authentication and maintains information for clients
        - Data communication is done **directly** between clients

Communication Processes
- **Process**: Program running within a host
    - Within same host, two processes communicate using **inter-process communication** (supported by OS)
    - Processes in different hosts communicate by **exchanging messages**
    - Client/Server: Client process initiates communication, server process waits to be contacted
    - P2P: Have both client and server processes

Sockets
- Process sends/receives messages to/from it's socket
- Socket analogous to *door*
    - Sending process shoves message out of a door
    - Sending process relies on transport infrastructure on other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process

Addressing Processes
- To receive messages, a process must have an **identifier**
- Host device has a unique IP address
- Identifier includes both **IP address** and **port numbers** associated with process on host
- Ex: Port numbers
    - HTTP server: 80
    - SMTP mail server: 25
- To send HTTP request to `www.cas.mcmaster.ca`:
    - IP address: 130.113.68.10
    - Port number: 80

Requirements of Common Apps

Internet Transport Protocols Service
- **TCP Service**
    - Reliable transport between sending/receiving processes
    - Flow Control: sender won't overwhelm receiver
    - Congestion Control: Throttle sender when network overloaded
    - Does not Provide: Timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
    - Connection-Oriented: Setup required between client and server processes
- **UDP Service**
    - Unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving processes
    - Does not Provide: reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, connection setup
    - Less overhead though
- Applications and their associated protocols
