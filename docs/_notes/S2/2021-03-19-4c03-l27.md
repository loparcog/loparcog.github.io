Elements of a Wireless Network
- Wireless Hosts (eg. laptop, smartphone, tablet)
    - Run applications
    - May be stationary or mobile
        - Wireless does *not* always mean mobile
- Base Stations
    - Typically conected to wired network
    - Relay - responsible for sending packets between wired network and wireless host(s) in its "area" (eg. cell towers, 802.11 access points)
- Wireless Link
    - Typically used to connect mobile(s) to base station
    - Also used as backbone link
    - Multiple access protocol coordinates link access
    - Various data rates, transmission distances
- Two modes to run a wireless network:
    - Infrastructure mode
        - Base station connects mobiles into wired network
        - Handoff: Mobile changes base station providing connection into wired network
    - Ad-hoc mode
        - No base stations
        - Nodes can only transmit to other nodes within link coverage
        - Nodes organize themselves into a network: route among themselves

802.11 LAN Architecture  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/802.PNG)
- Wireless host communicates with base station
    - Base station = access point (AP)
- **Basic Service Set (BSS)** (aka "cell")
    - In infrastructure mode, contains wireless hosts and access point (AP): base station
    - In ad hoc mode: host only (IBSS)
- Distribution System (DS)
    - Connects multiple APs
- Extended service set (ESS)
    - Two ore more basic service sets interconnected by DS
- Some examples on speed and non-overlapping channels in slides (389)

802.11 Frame: Addressing  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/802f.PNG)
- NOTE: Each number is in bytes
- More frame data  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/802f2.PNG)
- Frame Types
    - Management frame
        - Beacon
        - (De)association request/respond
        - Announcement traffic indication message
        - Authentication/deauthentication
    - Control frame
        - Poll frame and poll response frame
        - RTS
        - CTS
        - ACK
        - Power save (PS-poll)
    - Data frame
        - Limitation on payload size
        - Can be extended to 7395

Association
- Host must associate with an AP
    - Scans channels, listening for beacon frames containing service set identifier and AP's MAC address
        - SSID is 32 octets long
        - One SSID per network (BSS or IBSS)
    - Selects AP to associate with; initiates association protocol
    - May perform authentication
    - Will typically then run DHCP to get IP address in AP's subnet

802.11: Association
- **Passive Scanning**
    1. Beacon frames sent from APs
    2. Association Request frame sent: H1 to selected AP
    3. Association Response frame sent from selected AP to H1
- **Active Scanning**
    1. Probe Request frame broadcast from H1
    2. Probe Response frames sent from APs
    3. Association Request frame sent: H1 to selected AP
    4. Association Response frame sent from selected AP to H1
