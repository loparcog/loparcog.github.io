Digital Control Systems and Z-Transforms
===

Goals
- Introduce suitable mathematical models for analysis on discrete systems, so that we can build on the existing knowledge of continuous systems (CCS)
- How can we convert CCS transfer functions into equivalent transfer functions for DCS?
- If a stable CCS is transformed into a DCS, will it remain stable after conversion?

Sampling (Analog to Digital Converter)
- The analog signal is thus represented by a sequence of sampled values
- The conversion of analog signal takes place repetitively at instants of time that are *T* seconds apart
    - *T* is called the **sampling period**, and 1/*T* is called the **sampling rate** (cycles/s)
- The accuracy of the digital signal depends on the number of bits used to represent the samples
- **Sampling**: The process of taking values at discrete time intervals
- Amplitude values are represented using binary numbers of bits used to represent the samples

Quantization Error
- An example: Assume that three bits are used to represent a sampled value as a binary number. Let *M* be the maximum analog voltage that is divided into 8 levels of *M*/8 volts
- A 3-bit number can represent all of the eight levels (0 (000) to 7 (111)). Values that fall in between these levels must be approximated to the next higher/lower binary values
    - This may result in a maximum error of *M*/16 volts in a sampled digital output. In general, **quantization error** is equal to:  
    $$\frac{1}{2} * \frac{M}{2^n} = \frac{M}{2^{n+1}}$$  
    where *N* is the number of bits used for digitization
- The **resolution** of an A/D converter is the minimum value of the output that can be represented as a binary number, given as:  
$$\frac{M}{2^n}$$

Sampled Data System
- Input signals are available only at sample intervals of time (A2D conversion)
- Thus, the reference input *r* is a sequence of sample values $r(kT)$, instead of $r(t)$
- A sampler is basically a switch that closes every *T* seconds for one instant
- The equation is given as:  
$$r(kT)\delta(t - kT)$$
- An example of this can be seen in the following image:

Transfer Function of Sampled Data System
- Consider $r^*(t) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty r(kT)\delta(t-kT)$, using Laplace Transform, we get:  
$$R^* (s) = L(r^* (t)) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r(kT) e^{-ksT}$$
- We can transform the above series to a more manageable expression by defining the **Z-Transform**

Z-Transform (Laplace Transform of Sampled Data)
- In $L(r^* (t)) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r(kT) e^{-ksT}$, if we define $z=e^{sT}$, now the z-Transform is defined as:  
$$Z(r(t)) = Z(r*(t)) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty r(kT) z^{-k}$$
- In general, the z-Transform of a function f(t) is defined as:  
$$Z(f(t)) = F(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty f(kT) z^{-k}$$

A2D and D2A
- $r(t)$ and $p(t)$ are not the same!
    - However, if *T* is small enough, $p(t)$ is close to $r(t)$

Zero Order Hold (D2A Converter)
- A device that holds the sampled signal $r(t)$ to a constant value for the duration of the sampling period (ie. the ZOH would take the value $r(kT)$ and hold it constant for $kT \lt t \lt (k+1)T$)
- The transfer function is given as:  
$$L(u(t) - u(t-T)) = \frac{1}{s} - \frac{e^{sT}}{s}$$
- Example 1:

Transfer Function
- Start with this base system:  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4aa4/zt4.PNG)
- The transfer function of a continuous system is:  
$$G(s) = \frac{C(s)}{R(s)}$$  
where,  
$$R(s) = L(r(t)), C(s) = L(c(t))$$  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4aa4/zt5.PNG)
- The transfer function of a sampled system with discrete input and output is given by:  
$$G(z) = \frac{C(z)}{R(z)}, where $R(z), C(z)$ are z-transforms of the sampled input and output  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4aa4/zt6.PNG)
- Steps to find the discrete transfer function $G(z)$:
    1. Start with the frequency domain transfer function $G(s)$
    2. Find $g(t)$ using inverse Laplace Transform Tables
    3. Then use z-transform tables to find $G(z)$
    - NOTE: The discrete transfer function depends on the sampling period *T*
- Example:

Inverse z-Transform
- $G(z) \to x(k)$
- Methods:
    1. Power Series Method
    2. Partial-Fraction Expression Method
    3. Inversion-Formula Method (not covered)

Power Series Method
- If $G(z)$ is expressed as the ratio of two polynomials in *z*, we can write $G(z)$ in a power series:  
$$G(z) = a_0 + a_i z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2} + ...$$
- Example:  
$$G(z) = \frac{z}{z^2 - 3z + 2}$$
    - Using long division, we have:  
    $$G(z) = z^{-1} + 3z^{-2} + 7z^{-3} + 15z^{-4} + ...$$  
    hence,  
    $$g(0) = 0, g(T) = 1, g(2T) = 3, g(3T) = 7...$$

Partial-Fraction Expression Method
- Let's consider:  
$$\frac{z}{z-a} = 1 + az^{-1} + a^2 z^{-2} + a^3 z^{-3} + ...$$
- Write $G(z)$ in partial fraction expression, and use the above equation to find $g(k)$
- Example:  
$$G(z) = \frac{z}{(z-1)(z-2)} = \frac{-z}{z-1} + \frac{z}{z-2}$$  
$$= \sum_{k=0}^\infty (2^k - 1)z^{-k}$$  
Therefore,  
$$g(kT) = 2^k - 1$$
