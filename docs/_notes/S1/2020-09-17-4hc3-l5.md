Task Analysis
===

**Task Analysis**
- Analysis of how user tasks are performed in order to influence the design of our interface
- User and task analysis often done together to inform and guide UI design
    - User and task analysis occur before design takes place
    - Users can vary in many different ways
- Though distinct concepts, part of user and task analysis inform and overlap one another
- The following characteristics are very important to task analysis
    - **User domain knowledge**: How much expertise does the user have that is relevant to the interface's problem domain?
        - Ex: video editing problem domain (using iMovie vs Final Cut Pro)
        - Common breakdown of beginner vs expert, although in reality there's much more of a spectrum (ex. intermediate/average users)
    - **User roles**: What types of users are going to be using this UI?
        - Same system can have groups of users with defined roles
            - User vs administrator, writer vs editor, commonly associated with workplaces/tasks available
    - **Ethnographic Research**: Qualitative user research method based on observing users in their real-life environment
        - eg. Embedding yourself in a factory floor and observing different roles, what they involve
        - Can use interviews, surveys, and other research methods to inform task analysis too
            - Ethnographic research can be especially effective for discovering user roles, workflows, and tasks
    - **Tasks**: A goal-directed behaviour or series of behaviors involving the UI
        - Often hierarchical, represented in a tree structure
        - Tasks often made up of subtasks, which also can have subtasks
        - Sometimes the terms goals, activities, and process are all used instead of "task"
            - Eg. calling top-level tasks "goals" for example
        - **NOTE**: Whenever possible, try not to refer to the interface, *especially* specifics, when making tasks
            - Don't lock down what the interface has to look like or has to have
            - Using task analysis to *inform* UI design, not define it
            - Example, don't do "click the sort alphabetically arrow to sort", do "allow alphabetical sort"
            - Don't decide how things need to be done, just what needs to be done
        - For tasks and subtasks, a task could be searching the store for products, and subtasks could be filter search by catagory, filter by sales, sort by lowest to highest price, sort by highest to lowest
            - Could give these subtasks further subtasks, no limit, but ideally don't go too deep
        - Tasks are not specifically "functional requirements", since functional requirements could be disregarding any UI requirements
        - Subtasks can also be ordered if something needs to be done before another (ie. ringing up a customer has 1. enter customer items, 2. total items, 3. accept payment)
- Conducting task analysis 
    - Questions to consider:
        - What makes the user begin a task?
        - How do users complete a task?
        - What information does the user need to complete a task?
        - What tools do users need?
        - Do subtasks have an order?
        - How do users know a task is completed?
    - Try to limit subtasks to 4-8 subtasks
        - If more, we should make more layers in our hierarchy
- **Hierarchical task analysis** is a form of task analysis, adding concepts of operations and plans to a task hierarchy
    - **Operations** are the actions performed by the user, subtasks which cannot be broken down further
        - All bottom level tasks should be operations
        - Still abstract, "sort by X" instead of "click X"
    - **Plans** are how tasks are to be carried out, "first X, then Y, then Z"

Divergent and Convergent Thinking
===

How can we start designing?
- We analyzed users and their tasks
- We have methods for representing interfaces (sketches, wireframes, etc)
- But how do we start formulating and choosing designs?
- **Divergent thinking** is a thought process/method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions
    - Quantity over quality, novel ideas, creating choices
- **Convergent thinking** is the thought process or method to make a deliberate and conscious choice. We purposefully apply criteria as we screen, select, evaluate, and refine options
    - Analyze and filter, useful ideas, making decisions
- Divergent is similar to brainstorming, convergent is similar to analysis and judging
    - Divergent is more "right brain" (creative, artistic, solution generating), and convergent is more "left brain" (logical, analytical, solution reducing)
    - These solutions should both be attempted though the ideas of right and left brain is pretty dumb. Should still be aware of this though because the backing of more logical solutions vs more creative solutions is sometimes needed
- Divergent is commonly for creating a bunch of ideas, convergent for gathering facts to come up with an answer
    - Both are used as part of design thinking though
- **Design thinking** is a design process and set of related tools for creative problem solving
    - We'll talk more about design processes for UI later
    - Can use divergent and convergent thinking together

        - Recommended to do this, generate many ideas and start analyzing them logically to get to the best solution
        - Divergent more for working on needs and possible solutions, convergent is for making the **design decisions** for what solution will be used
        - Can also be used for finding problems as well
- How to think in these ways?
    - We can train ourselves to do this
    - Next week will focus on convergent thinking in the form of design decisions, design heuristics, principles, theories, etc
    - Thinking divergently could be done further with...
        - Brainstorming
        - Thought journals 
        - "Freewriting" (writing without stopping or proofreading until done)
        - Mindset adjusting
        - Oxymoron (explore what happens when you remove the most essential idea behind a product/concept)
        - Arbitrary constraints (setting fake barriers to try to work around)
        - Brainwriting
        - Lateral thinking (solving problems in illogical ways, things you think wouldn't work even)
        - SCAMPER
