Point Estimators Continued
===

To compare point estimators
1. Mean/expected value of point estimators biased/unbiased  
AAA (img)
2. Variance of estimators (standard error)
    - Looking for minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE)
3. Mean + Variance
    - Mean square error (MSE):  
    $$E[(\hat{\Theta} - \theta)^2] = V(\hat{\Theta}) + (bias)^2$$

Random Sample
- The random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are a **random sample** of size *n* if:
    1. The $X_i$'s are independent random variables
    2. Every $X_i$ has the same probability distribution
    - Note, sample data ($x, y, z$) is just a set of data, but a random sample ($X, Y, Z$) is actually a random variable
    - Ex: Surveying data for everyone in Toronto. Can't do everyone, so we take 1000 people, this would be a **random sample**. After the survey, we will have data results, representing **sample data**

Central Limit Theorem
- If $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ is a random sample of size *n* taken from a population (finite or infinite) with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$ and if $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, the limiting form of the distribution is:  
$$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$  
as $n \rightarrow \inf$, is the standard normal distribution
- Ex: Pipe manufacturing with diameter (population) $\mu = 3.2cm, $\sigma = 0.01cm$. Find the probability that a random sample of 40 pipes will have sample mean ($\bar{X}$) between 3.199cm and 3.202cm
    - SOLN:  
    Random sample size $n=40$, and $40 \geq 30$  
    by Central Limit Theorem (CLT), we know sample mean $\bar{X} ~ N(\mu, (\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})^2)  
    $$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} ~ N(0,1)$$  
    We can then rewrite this as a probability:  
    $$P(3.199 \leq \bar{X} \leq 3.202) = P(\frac{3.199 - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \leq \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \leq \frac{3.202 - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}})$$  
    $$= P(\frac{3.199 - 3.2}{0.01 / \sqrt{40}} \leq Z \leq \frac{3.202 - 3.2}{0.01 / \sqrt{40}})$$  
    $$= P(-0.63 \leq Z \leq 1.26)$$  
    Then use the table to solve this:  
    $$\phi(1.26) - \phi(-0.63)$$  
    $$= 0.631818$$

Approximate Sampling Distribution of a Difference in Sample Means
- If we have two independent populations with mean $\mu_1, \mu_2$ and variances $\sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2$, AAA (finish)  
$$Z = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2/n_1 + \sigma_2^2/n_2}}$$  
is approximately standard normal if the conditions of the central limit theorem apply. If the two populations are normal, the sampling distribution of *Z* is exactly standard normal
- Ex: Two independent random samples of two sets of steel are taken, produced by an old and new method.  
Old (1) - population: $\mu_1 = 11 kg/cm^2, \sigma_1 = 1.5kg/cm^2$, random sample: $n_1 = 30$  
New (2) - population: $\mu_2 = 15 kg/cm^2, \sigma_2 = 1kg/cm^2$, random sample: $n_2 = 35$  
Find the probability of the difference between the two sample means ($\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) is larger than $3.5 kg/cm^2$
    - SOLN:  
    Because $n_1 = 30 \geq 30, n_2 = 35 \geq 30$, we can use CLT, and get:  
    $$\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 ~ N(\mu_1 - \mu_2, \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2})$$  
    $$Z = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2/n_1 + \sigma_2^2 / n_2}} ~ N(0,1)$$  
    $$P(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 \geq 3.5) = P(\frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2/n_1 + \sigma_2^2 / n_2}} \geq \frac{3.5 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2/n_1 + \sigma_2^2 / n_2}})$$  
    $$=P(Z \geq \frac{3.5 - (15 - 11)}{\sqrt{(1.5)^2/30 + 1^2/35}})$$  
    $$= P(Z \geq -1.55)$$  
    Need to inverse to use table values:  
    $$= 1 - P(Z \leq -1.55)$$  
    $$= 1 - \phi(-1.55)$$  
    $$= 0.939429$$
