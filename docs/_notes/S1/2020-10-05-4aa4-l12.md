Tasks & Frames
===

Example from Last Lecture
- Given the task set: $T_1(4, 1); T_2(5, 1); T_3(10, 2)$...
    - a) Determine the size of the hyperperiod  
    SOLN:  
    $$H = LCM(4, 5, 10) = 20$$
    - b) Find suitable frame sizes  
    SOLN:  
    Process through constraints:  
    $$C_1: f \geq 2$$  
    $$C_2: f \text{ can be 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}$$  
    $$C_3: 2f - GCD(P_i, f) \leq D_i$$  
    We can now look for suitable frame sizes:  
    f = 2 is suitable  
    f = 4 is not, since $T_1: 8-4 = 4, T_2: 8-1 = 7 \gt 5$  
    f = 5 is not, since $T_1: 10-1 \gt 4$  
    Therefore, **f=2**  is the suitable frame size

    - c) Choose a reasonable frame size and give a cyclic executive schedule of these three tasks in a hyperperiod using the network flow model  
    SOLN:

    Connect the lines from task to frame to distribute all tasks (note that you can only have the frame size going to each frame, and then you can calculate max flow from that)

Brief Review
- Given a set of real time tasks and a scheduling algorithm, is the task set schedulable?
    - If yes, then all deadlines will be met forever
    - If no, then at some point a deadline will be missed
- Ways to schedule:
    - Cyclic executive
    - Static priorities
    - Dynamic priorities
        - Priorities computed at runtime
        - More flexible, less predictable
Static Priority Assignment
- A higher priority task is executed before a lower priority task
- Priority based on criticality?
    - If we consider hard real-time applications, they are on the same level of importance
- **Rate Monotonic (RM)**: Shorter period tasks get higher priority
- **Deadline Monotonic (DM)**: Tasks with shorter relative deadlines get higher priority
- Both RM and DM...
    - Have good theoretical properties
    - Work well in practice
- RM Assumptions
    - Tasks are running on a uniprocessor system
    - Task are preemptive
    - There is no OS overhead for preemption
- Rate Monotonic (RM) Scheduling Algorithm
    - Static-priority preemptive approach, and one of the most popular algorithms
    - At any time instant, an RM scheduler executes the instance of the ready task that has the highest priority
    - The priority of a task is inversely related to its period, lower period has higher priority
        - If same period, priority selected at random
- Ex: Given the set of periodic tasks:  
$T_1$: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, ...  
$T_2$: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, ...  
$T_3$: 2, 22, 42, 62, ...  
    - Can use a 4-tuple to represent each as well:  
    $T_1 (0, 5, 2, 5)$  
    $T_2 (1, 4, 1, 4)$  
    $T_3 (2, 20, 2, 20)$  
- Can RM make the tasks meet their deadlines?  
SOLN:  
The tasks can be displayed as follows:  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4aa4/tsq4.png)
- Difference between CE and RM
    - $T_1(2, 1)$ and $T_2(3, 1)$  
    What will happen if an instance (say the second) of $T_1$ is delayed for 1 time unit?
    - With CE (f=1):  
    $T_1, T_2, T_1, T_2, T_1, |$ (no late arrival)  
    $T_1 T_2 ? T_2 T_1 |$ (deadline missed when 2nd instance of $T_1$ is late)
    - With RM:  
    $T_1, T_2, T_1, T_2, T_1, |$ (no late arrival)  
    $T_1 T_2 | T_1 T_1 T_2$ (all deadlines met when the 2nd instance of $T_1$ is late)
- Schedulability Test
    - Determining if a specific set of tasks satisfying certain criteria can be successfully scheduled (completing execution of every task by its deadline) using a specific scheduler
    - This test is often done @ compile time, before the computer system and its tasks start execution
- Optimal Scheduler
    - One which may fail to meet the deadline of a task, **only if** no other scheduler can meet it
    - Note that "optimal" in real-time scheduling does not mean "fastest average response time" or "shortest average waiting time", aimed at getting tasks to meet their deadlines
- Schedulability Test for RM (Test 1)
    - There are *n* periodic processes, independent and preemptable
    - $D_i \geq p_i$ for all processes
    - Periods of all processes are integer multiples of each other
    - A **necessary and sufficient condition** for such tasks to be scheduled on a uniprocessor system using RM is the following algorithm:  
    $$U = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{e_i}{p_i} \leq 1$$
- Example: Consider a task set with three tasks:  
$T_1: (4;1)$  
$T_2: (2;1)$  
$T_3: (8;2)$  
- Is this task set schedulable?
    - Note that $p_1 = 2p_2, p_3 = 4p_2 = 2p_1$
    - The task set belongs to the special class of takss for which the above schedulability test applies
    - Now $U = 1/4 + 1/2 + 2/8 = 1$  
    - Therefore the task set is RM schedulable
- Schedulability Test for RM (Test 2)
    - If the tasks have arbitrary periods, a *sufficient* but not necessary schedulability condition is:  
    $$U \leq n(2^{1/n} - 1)$$  
    Task sets with a utilization smaller than $n(2^{1/n} - 1)$ are schedulable by RM algorithm
    - For different n values, we get...  
    $$n = 1 \rightarrow U \leq 1$$  
    $$n = 2 \rightarrow U \leq 0.824$$  
    $$n = \inf \rightarrow U \leq 0.693$$  
        - Proof for infinity case is in the slides
