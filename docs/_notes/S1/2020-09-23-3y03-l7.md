Distribution Cont
===

Ex1: When a person is exposed to a certain disease, the probability they will be infected is 0.3.
- Assume 10 people exposed to this disease one by one. Let X be the number of people who are infected.
- Q: What is P(X=3), E(X), V(X), and $\sigma$?  
SOLN:  
Remember, the equations for these values are:  
$P(X) = f(x_i)$  
$E[X] = \sum_{x_i} x_i f(x_i)$  
$V(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2]$  
From the data, we can see that X is a binomial random variable, and can therefore use those functions to solve this.  
$P(X=3) = f(3) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$  
n = the number of people exposed total (10)  
x = the number of people we want to find probability for being infected (3)  
p = probability of someone infected (0.3)  
This gives us...  
$P(X=3) = f(3) = \binom{10}{3} (0.3)^3 (1-0.3)^{10-3}$  
$= **0.2668**$  
Now for the average...
$\mu = E[X] = np = (10)(0.3) = **3**$  
Now for the variance...  
$\sigma^2 = V(X) = n p (1-p) = 10*0.3*(1-0.3) = **2.1**$  
Finally, for standard deviation...  
$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{2.1} = **1.449**$  

Ex2: The probability of one person catching a certain disease after being exposed to it is 0.3
- Let X be the number of people exposed to the virus **until the first infection**
- Q: What is P(X=3), $\mu$, $\sigma^2$, and $\sigma$?  
SOLN:  
Very similar to last question, but this one is one waits until the first infection. This would make this problem a **geometric distribution**, which we can then use to get the new probability formula:  
$P(X=3) = f(3) = (1-p)^{x-1} p$  
(p = 0.3, X = 3)  
$= (1-0.3)^2 * 0.3 = **0.147**$  
Now for the average...  
$\mu = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{0.3} = **3.333**$  
Now for the variance...
$\sigma^2 = $frac{1-p}{p^2} = \frac{1-0.3}{0.3^2} = **7.778**$  
Finally, for the standard deviation...  
$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{7.778}$

Ex3: Same as first (p = 0.3)
- Let X be the number of people exposed to the virus **until the third infection**
- Q: What is P(X=3), $\mu$, and $\sigma^2$?  
SOLN:  
This waiting until the third infection is a specific number of cases, making X a **negative binomial** random variable. Using the equations, we can now get  
$P(X=3) = f_{NB}(3) = \binom{x-1}{r-1} (1-p)^{x-r} p^r$  
(p = 0.3, X = 3, r = 3 (since it's until the third infection))  
$= \binom{3-1}{3-1} (1-0.3)^{3-3} 0.3^3$  
Now for the average...  
$\mu = $frac{r}{p} = \frac{3}{0.3} = **10**$  
Now for the variance...  
$\sigma^2 = \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2} = \frac{3(1-0.3)}{0.3^2}$

Ex4: Assume there are 30 people, and 3 of them have a certain disease. Select 5 people randomly from the group as a sample
- Let X be the number of people who have this disease in the sample
- Q: What is P(X=1), $\mu$, and $\sigma^2$?  
SOLN:  
This question would make X a **hyper geometric distribution**, which would give us equations to get  
$P(X=1) = f_{HG}(1) = \frac{\binom{k}{x} \binom{N-k}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}}$  
k = number of success in population (3)  
N = number of population (30)  
n = number in sample (5)  
$= \frac{\binom{3}{1} \binom{30-3}{5-1}}{\binom{30}{5}} = 0.3695$  
Now for average...  
$\mu = np$  
p = $ of success in population / # in population = 3/30
$= 5 * \frac{3}{30} = 0.5$  
Finally for distribution...  
$\sigma^2 = np(1-p) \binom{N-n}{N-1}$  
$= 5 * \frac{3}{30} * (1- \frac{3}{30}) * \binom{30-5}{30-1} = 0.388$
