Reliability Continued

Machine Repair Problem
- *N* machines, each fail independently with rate $\lambda$
- *M* servers for repairs, each works on a single machine with repair rate $\mu$
- This is a birth-death process, proceed as in CTMC material
- Consider a machine repair problem with three machines. Assume $\lambda = 0.001$ and $\mu = 1$. Calculate the probability that all three machines are working with both one server and two servers
    - SOLN:  
    Make a four state machine, each being the number of failed machines (0,1,2,3), making the machine fail with rates $N_{01} = 0.003, N_{12} = 0.002, N_{23} = 0.001$, and all repair/processing rates with one server as $\mu = 1$  
    This gives us $\pi_0 = 0.997$  
    For two servers, the processing rate now changes to $N_{10} = 1, N_{21} = 2, N_{32} = 2$, since only one server can work on one broken machine  
    This also gives us $\pi_0 = 0.997$, but a bit larger than one server
- Capacity planning
    - Need *N* servers for performance requirement (M/M/*N* model)
    - We can choose $N' \geq N$ such that $P(N \text{ working}) \geq P$, to take into account that some of the servers have failed, where P is the probability uptime of *N* servers, given *N'* servers
- Assumptions from this problem
    - Repair times exponentially distributed could be a problematic assumption
    - Turns out to be not too sensitive, as long as repair times are (much) less than failure times

Mean Time to Failure
- May be interested in mean time to failure, for example in the previous problem, what is the mean time from all machines working to no machines working (or any other states)?
- Usual CTMC approach not appropriate here though, if we consider a terminal state, steady state analysis fails
- However, we can solve the problem if we define $T_{i,j}$ to be the time to go from state *i* to state *j*, $1/\gamma_i$ to be the expacted time spent in state *i*, and $P_{ij}$ to be the probability that the next state after state *i* is state *j*
- Define state 0 to be the initial state, state *N* to be the final state, define MTTF as the time to go between state 0 and *N*
- For each state $j=0, ..., N-1$, write:  
$$E[T_{j,N} = \frac{1}{\gamma_j} + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} P_{jk} E[T_{k, N}]$$
- Gives a system of *N* equations and *N* unknowns, we're interested in $E[T_{0,N}]$
- Ex: This type of model is used in a variety of settings - a system has three states (operational, suboptimal, outage)
    - Critical failures leading to outage occur at rate $\lambda_c$ when either operation or suboptimal
    - Transition to suboptimal state at rate $\lambda_d$
    - Repair from suboptimal at rate $\mu_d$
    - Repair from outage to optimal at rate $\mu_c$
    - Interested in MTTF
    - SOLN;  
    Let the following values represent each state:  
    0: Operational  
    1: Suboptimal  
    2: Outage  
    We get rates:  
    $$\lambda_{01} = \lambda_d, \lambda_{12} = \lambda_cm \lambda_{02} = \lambda_c$$  
    $$\mu_{10} = \mu_d, \mu_{20} = \mu_c$$  
    For MTTF, we want to know $E[T_{0,2}]$, which is given as:  
    $$E[T_{0,2}] = \frac{1}{\lambda_d + \lambda_c} + \frac{\lambda_d}{\lambda_d + \lambda_c}E[T_{1,2}] + \frac{\lambda_c}{\lambda_d + \lambda_c} E[T_{2,2}]$$  
    Note that $E[T_{2,2}] = 0$, since it takes no time to go to a state you're already going to. We also can get the equation:   
    $$E[T_{1,2}] = \frac{1}{\lambda_c + \mu_d} + \frac{\mu_d}{\lambda_c + \mu_d} E[T_{0,2}]$$  
    We can then put some assumed values from the question $\lambda_d = 1/8, \lambda_c = 1/80, \mu_d = 1/6$, giving us $E[T_{0,2}] = 80$  
        - These equations can also be auto generated using the diagram, conceptually this does not get more difficult, just more variables
