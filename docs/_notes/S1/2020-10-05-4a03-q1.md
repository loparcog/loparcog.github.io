- Difference between rights and morals?
    - Is there a difference? *Should* there be a difference?
- **Ethics**: A branch of philosophy concerned with ways of thinking philisophically about morality, and moral judgement
    - Not a strict science
    - Many examples like rights-based, utilitarianism, etc.
    - More theory than a "strict set of rules", can be influenced by many external factors like culture, religion, etc.
- **Law**: The system of rules which a particular country/community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and which it may enforce by the imposition of penalties
    - Very different to ethics, more rigid
    - Ethics applies to an individuals decisions in certain situations, and can be interpreted differently, but law determines what a society views acceptable or not, and is upheld by the government of that society
- Law always creates a rigid framework, encouraged by society to uphold
- Ethics is more intrepretation, up to personal preference
    - Commonly accepted, but not enforced
    - Should laws be made to always ethical?
        - Many examples where laws are unethical, and ethical decisions are illegal
- **Whistleblowing** is a great example to explain the difference
    - Evan said that standards were too lax when inspecting pipelines, which could cause problems for TransCanada, standing for ethics and safety concerns
    - Law could determine that trans canada was doing the right inspection though, even if it not up to the standards Evan expected
