UI Design: Theories
===

Theories
- High-level widely applicable frameworks to draw on during design and evaluation
    - Also supports communication and teaching
    - Can be predictive, pointing to a solution, or descriptive
- More abstract than principles and guidelines, requires more interpretation
- Fitts' Law
    - Predicts the time for a user to point to a target area is a function of the width of the target and the distance to the target
    - A scientific law surprisingly, on par with the 7 +/- 2 memory limit
        - Has its own mathematical equation, along with *mean pointing time*. Not important, just interesting to note
    - Been tested over decades, even adapted for accessible things like using a tongue as a pointing device
    - In practice, equation not used to find best button sizes/positions, but core idea behind can be used for better design decisions
    - Also deals with making "bad/dangerous" options far away from the main group of buttons for the user, avoid accidental clicking
    - Corners of the screen always fast to reach, but corners of a window not at the corner of the screen are commonly hard to reach, making them the last valuable screen space
- Norman's 7 Stages of Actions
    - Users undergo these stages while interacting with an interface, arranged in a cyclical pattern:
    1. Forming the goal
        - What user wants to do
    2. Forming the intention
        - What task to perform
    3. Specifying the action
        - How to perform task with UI
    4. Executing the action
        - Performing task
    5. Perceiving the system state
        - Look at results
    6. Interpreting the system state
        - Understand results
    7. Evaluating the outcome
        - See if your goal was achieved
    - Also the following definitions:
        - **Mapping**: Relationship between the elements of two sets of things (ie. mapping between light switches and lights)
        - **Conceptual Model**: An explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works (ie. folder and file icons help the user to create a conceptual model that explain how a file system of a computer works, although that's not how it actually does on the lower level)
        - **Feedback**: Communication about results of an action (ie. a light flashing when a job is done or a notification a message has sent)
        - **System Image**: Complete picture of the interface that the user has (not just the UI, but also the understanding of how similar interfaces work, instruction manuals, and sales/marketing videos)
- Four Principles of Good Design
    - Principles suggested by the previous 7 stages:
    1. The state and the action alternatives should be visible
    2. There should be a good conceptual model with a consistent system image
    3. The interface should include good mappings that reveal the relationships between stages
    4. Users should receive continuous feedback
- Gulf of Evaluation
    - The degree to which the interface provides representations that can be directly perceived and interpreted in terms of the expectations and intentions of the user
    - When the state of the system presented to the user is out of line with the user's expectations
        - If the presentation and user understanding line up, there is a very small/great gulf of evaluation. If they do not, it is a large/poor gulf
        - Ex. If a OS did nothing when transferring files, there would be a poor gulf, you don't know what to expect. However, if you got a spinner/hourglass, you would know something is happening, but you still don't know what's happening, making a smaller gulf but still not the best
            - Great/small gulf of evaluation for this would be something like the windows transfer window, where it tells you what's being moved, how long in time/size remains, and a graphical representation
- Affordances
    - Important concept in interface design, some varying definitions though
    - The action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor
        - ie. the handle on a kettle makes it readily perceivable to the user they can hold the kettle by the handle
    - Updated definition: Relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used
        - Given the object properties and the capabilities of the actor, what does the object allow for?
        - Based off both object properties and user capabilities, the relationship between them
- Signifiers
    - Affordances determine what actions are possible, and signifiers communicate where the action should take place
    - Refer to any mark/sound, or any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person
        - Created to indicate what is possible/what to do
        - Ex. Slide bar to power off an iPod, the horizontal bar with the mark on one side signifies to slide
        - Ex2. A water bottle lock with a lock/unlock symbol on it, signifying that this button would lock/unlock the lid
    - Some UI examples are things like 3D buttons (letting users know what is/isn't clickable)
