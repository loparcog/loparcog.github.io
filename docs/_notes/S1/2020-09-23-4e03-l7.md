Further State/Distribution
===

Quick continuation, moving states
- Main calculation looks like  
$E[T_{j, N]}] = 1 + \sum_{l=1}^N P_{j, l} E[T_{l, N}]$  
- Set $E[T_{N, N}]$ to 0 wherever it appears and solve

**Infinite State Discrete-Time Markov Chains**
- Same results hold here, relating to limiting and stationary distributions, only the proofs are trickier
    - Interchanging limits and infinite sums tricky
- Key issue: Must solve an *infinite* number of linear equations in an *infinite* number of unknowns
- Ex: Consider a system that operates as follows:
    - At each time point, probability 0.05 a job arrives, otherwise no jobs arrive
    - At each time point, probability 0.1 a job departs (if at least one job is present), otherwise no jobs depart
    - Both an arrival and departure can happen at once
    - If one or more jobs in system, probability of an increase of one is r=(0.05)(1-0.1) = 0.045
    - Probability of a decrease by one is s=(0.1)(1-0.05) = 0.095
    - Infinite buffer space to hold jobs
    - Probability of no change is 1-r-s = 0.86
    - Assume that if 0 jobs are in the system, probability of an increase of one is r, otherwise stays at 0
    - The following transition matrix for this problem looks like:  
    $$ P = \begin{bmatrix}
    1-r & r & 0 & 0 & ... //
    s & 1-r-s & r & 0 & ... //
    0 & s & 1-r-s & r & ... //
    ... & ... & s & 1-r-s & ... //
    ... & ... & ... & ... & ... //
    \end{bmatrix}$$
        - Note it is mostly the same row, other than the first row, replicating and moving over one column
    - The stationary equations for this matrix is:  
    $\pi_0 = \pi_0(1-r) + \pi_1 s$  
    $\pi_1 = \pi_0r + \pi_1(1-r-s) + \pi_2s$  
    $\pi_2 = \pi_1r + \pi_2(1-r-s) + \pi_3s$  
    $\pi_3 = \pi_2r + \pi_3(1-r-s) + \pi_4s$  
    Along with the infinite set of equations  
    $1 = \pi_0 + \pi_1 + \pi_2 + ...$
        - Can move things around to make a representation of anything by $\pi_0$
    - First equation rearranges to $\pi_1 = (\frac{r}{s})\pi_0$  
    - Second equation goes to $\pi_2 = (\frac{r}{s})^2\pi_0$ 
    - Gets us the general equation:  
    $\pi_n = (\frac{r}{s})^n\pi_0$ 
    - Can check that guess works by induction (assume true for n-1, show it's true for n)
        - What do we do past this though? We don't know $\pi_0$
    - We know that $\sum \pi_n = 1$, so we can then get:  
    $\pi_0 (1 + \frac{r}{s} + (\frac{r}{s})^2 + ...) = 1$  
    $\pi_0 (\frac{1}{1- \frac{r}{s}}) = 1$  
    $\pi_0 = 1 - \frac{r}{s}$
        - The infinite summation converges is r/s is less than 1, giving us the fraction value, which we then use to solve for $\pi_0$
        - If r/s was larger than 1, jobs would go to infinity, in which there would never be a solution
    - Can then work towards the final result:  
    $\pi_n = (\frac{r}{s})^n (1- \frac{r}{s})$  
    $= \rho^n (1-\rho)$  
    Where $\rho = r/s$
        - Expected number in the system in slides, along with a graph showing the total turns essentially exponential as $\rho$ approaches 1

DTMCs and PageRank
- Search engine matches search terms, but also ranks
- Wish to rank pages based on popularity (assume match already done)
- Proposal 1
    - The popularity of a page is determined by the number of backlinks to it
        - Number of other pages linking to it
    - Doesn't work so well, not all links are equal
        - A link from a popular page should count more than one from a less popular page
        - To get a high rank, just create many pages pointing to the web page
- Proposal 2
    - Look at the number of pages linked to the *backlinked* pages
    - Another easily fooled system, have all pages linked to each other
        - Can keep doing this for any number of backlinked pages checked
- Let $\pi_i$ be the "popularity" of page i
    - If $pi_i \gt $pi_j$, then page i is ranked higher
- We can calculate $\pi_i$ as:  
$\pi_i = \sum_{j=1}^N \pi_j P_{j, i}$
    - Sum of popularity of pages linked to i as well as probability to go from page j to page i
- This is the vanilla page rank alg
    - How do we end up getting the $P_{j, i}$ values?
- How the algorithm works:
    1. Determine all pages and links between pages
    2. Create a DTMC where the states are the pages, and there is a transition from page *i* to page *j* if and only if there is a link from page *i* to page *j*
    3. If page i has $k_i$ outgoing links, then the probability of the corresponding transitions from i to j are $\frac{1}{k_i}$
    4. Solve this DTMC, higher limiting probability means higher rank
