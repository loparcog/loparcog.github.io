Dynamic UI w/ Websockets
===

Synchronous Page Loading
- All data for the app must be presented on the initial page load
    - No real-time data integration
- All information, even common elements, are reloaded
    - Pretty process intensive, not the best UI plan
    - There must be a better way!
AJAX
- Asynchronos Javascript and XML
    - XHTML for content
    - CSS for presentation
    - DOM for dynamic content display
- Client makes a request to the server ("pull"), and the server gives it data to display
    - This can be done after the page is loaded, no information required
    - How to push data from frontend to server though?
Websockets
- Two-way event-driven communication between web browser and server
- Great for real-time applications (games, servers)
    - Allows for push updated to the client as well as data pushes from client to server

Code Walkthrough
- Will need some server code, going to use Node.js
    - Also using socket.io!
- Declare all of these, declaring socket as `io`
- To run anything on a user connection, use:  
```js
io.on('connection', function(socket){
    // Run anything here for on connection
    console.log("A user connected");

    // Also include any live events
    socket.on('chat message', function(msg){
        console.log(msg);

        // Emit to send to all currently connected sockets
        io.emit('chat message', msg);
    });

    // Can also include any disconnection
    socket.on('disconnect', function(){
        console.log("User disconnected")
    })
});
```
- Some CSS is shown in the tutorial to specifically make the chat app used
- The basic structure of the CSS is given as follows:  
```html
<body>
    <ul id="messages"></ul>
    <form id="chat" action="">
        <input id="message" autocomplete="off" />
        <button>Send</button>
    </form>

    <script src="socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    <script>
    // All JS goes here
    </script>
</body>
```
- To run on the frontend, we can use:  
```js
var socket = io();

document.getElementById("chat").onsubmit = function() 
{
    // Push to the server using socket.emit
    // Get the value in the input box and send it to the server
    socket.emit('chat message', document.getElementById("message").value);

    // Clear the text box
    document.getElementById("message").value = "";

    // Stop the default action of form submit happening
    return false;
};
```
- I swear we also need something to fetch the data from the server and add it to the chat list but not sure where that is
    - Defined by a `socket.on` call
