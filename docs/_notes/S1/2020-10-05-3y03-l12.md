Normal Random Variable Approximation
===

Probability Notes
- Note for any normal random variable, the distributions are given as follows
    - For distribution with average $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the probability range is given as:  
        - $\mu - \sigma \rightarrow \mu + \sigma = 68.27%$
        - $\mu - 2\sigma \rightarrow \mu + 2\sigma = 95.45%$
        - $\mu - 3\sigma \rightarrow \mu + 3\sigma = 99.73%$
    - These ranges can also be divided in half to just get the negative or positive ranges
- There are two approximations in the textbook for normal approximation to the binomial distribution, but we're only going to be using one (Continuity Correction)

Ex1: Assume you have a multiple choice test with 60 questions, each with 5 choices per question. One student guesses the answer randomly each time (equally likely event to get it right. Find the probability that the student gets between 10 and 20 questions right.
- SOLN:  
Let *X* be the number of correct answers in the test  
Since there is only success/fail in this experiment, this is a Bernoulli trial with success probability $\frac{1}{5}$, and each event is independent from one another. Therefore, X is a binomial random variable.  
$$P(10 \leq X \leq 20) = \sum_{X=10}^{20} f(x) = \sum_{X=10}^{20} \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$
This calculation would be very tedious. Can we use a Normal random variable to approximate X?
    - Going to use an approximation level of 5 since that is good enough for many use cases
- We can then calculate to see if we are above our approximation range:  
$$np \gt 5$$  
$$60*\frac{1}{5} = 12 \gt 5$$
$$n(1-p) \gt 5$$  
$$60*\frac{4}{5} = 48 \gt 5$$  
Everything fits in the approximation range, no need to edit it, can then use the formula to calculate this:  
$$P(10 \leq X \leq 20) = P(10 - 0.5 \leq X \leq 20 + 0.5)$$  
$$= P(\frac{10 - 0.5 - np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}} \leq Z \leq \frac{20 + 0.5 - np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}})$$  
$$= P(-0.81 \leq Z \leq 2.74)$$  
$$= P(Z \leq 2.74) - P(Z \leq -0.81)$$  
Now, use the table to get the values of the above (can google the table or use the textbook, better to use the one in the appendix of the textbook):  
$$= 0.996928 - 0.208970$$  
$$= 0.787958$$

Exponential vs Poisson
- Poisson random variable: # of customers arriving in a fixed length of time
- Exponential random variable: Waiting time between arrivals from a Poisson process
    - Consult the youtube channel for a more in-depth explanation

Ex2: Time between calls arriving in one service office is an exponential random variable with 5 calls/hr
- a) Find the probability someone working in the office received one call in the next 2 hours  
SOLN:  
This question is the same as asking if the waiting time is less than or equal to 2hrs, mathematically shown as $P(X \leq 2)$  
$$P(X \leq 2) = \int_0^2 f(x) dx$$  
(Where $\lambda$ is from 5 calls/hr, giving us 0.2 hr/call)
$$= \int_0^2 \lambda e^{- \lambda x} dx$$  
$$= \int_0^2 0.2 e^{-0.2 x} dx$$  
$$= -e^{-0.2(2)} - (-e^{-0.2(0)})$$  
$$= 0.33$$
- b) Find the probability the worker receives a call in the next 2 hours **given** they have waited 5 hours for it  
SOLN:  
$$P(X \leq 2+5 | X \geq 5)$$  
$$= \frac{P(X \leq 7 \cap X \geq 5)}{P(X \geq 5)}$$  
NOTE: The following was done in the next lecture  
$$= \frac{P(5 \leq X \leq 7)}{P(X \geq 5)}$$  
$$= \frac{\int_5^7 f(x) dx}{\int_5^{\inf}f(x) dx}$$  
Computing the integrals...  
$$\int_5^7 0.2 e^{-0.2x} dx, u=-0.2x, u' =-0.2$$  
$$= -e^{-0.2x} |_5^7$$  
$$= e^{-1.4} - (- e^{-1})$$
$$\int_5^{\inf} 0.2e^-0.2x dx$$  
$$= -e^{-0.2x} |_5^{\inf}$$  
$$= -e^{-\inf} - (-e^{-1})$$  
$$= e^{-1}$$
Subbing back in...  
$$= \frac{-e^{-1.4}+e^{-1}}{e^{-1}} \approx 0.33$$  
This all represents the memoryless property as well
