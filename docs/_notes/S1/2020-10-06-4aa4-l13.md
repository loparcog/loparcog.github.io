RM Schedulability Continued
===

Schedulability Test for RM (Test 3)
- A *sufficient and necessary* condition for scheduability by RM algorithm can be derived as follows:
    - Consider a set of tasks $(T_1; T_2; ...; T_i)$, with $(p_1 \lt p_2 \lt ... \lt p_i)$
    - __Assume all tasks are in phase__
    - The moment $T_1$ is released, the processor will interrupt anything else it is doing and start processing this task as it has the highest priority (lowest period). Therefore the only condition that must be satisfied to ensure that $T_1$ can be feasibly scheduled is that:  
    $$e_1 \leq p_1$$
    - This is clearly a necessary and sufficient condition
    - The task $T_2$ will be executed successfully if its first iteration can find enough time over the time interval $(0; p_2)$, that is not used by $T_1$ 
        -$p_2$ is the period of $T_2$ and the first instance of $T_2$ must complete before the second instance arrives
    - Suppose $T_2$ finishes at *t*. The total number of instances of task $T_1$ released over the time interval $[0; t)$ is $[\frac{t}{p_1}]$
    - If $T_2$ is to finish at *t*, then every instance of task $T_1$, released during time interval $(0; t)$, must be completed, and in addition, there must be $e_2$ time available for execution of $T_2$, ie. the following condition must be satisfied:  
    $$t = [\frac{t}{p_1}e_1 + e_2]$$ 
- How do we find such *t* for $T_2$?
    - Note: Every interval has an infinite number of points, so we cannot exhaustively check for all possbible *t*
    - Consider $[\frac{t}{p_1}]$, it only changes at multiples of $p_1$, with jumps of $e_1$. So if we can find an integer k, such that time  
    $$t = k * p_1 \gt k * e_1 + e_2$$  
    and,  
    $$k*p_1 \leq p_2$$  
    we have the necessary and sufficient condition for $T_2$ to be schedulable under the RM algorithm
- Consider task $T_3$
    - It is sufficient to show that the first instance of $T_3$ completes before the arrival of its next instance at $p_3$. If $T_3$ completes its execution by *t*, then by an argument similar to that for $T_2$, we must have:  
    $$t = [\frac{t}{p_1}]e_1 + [\frac{t}{p_2}]e_2 + e_3$$  
    - $T_3$ is schedulable iff there is some $t \in (0; p_3)$ such that the above condition is satisfied
    - Also remember that the right side of the equation only changes for multiples of $p_1$ and $p_2$
- General Statement for Test 3
    - The time demand function for task $i (1 \leq i \leq n)$ is given as:
    $$\omega_i (t) = \sum_{k=1}^i [\frac{t}{p_k}] e_k \leq t, 0 \leq t \leq p_i$$  
    This holds for **any time instant t** chosen as follows:  
    $$t = k_jp_j, (j=1, ..., i)$$  
    and  
    $$k_j = 1, ..., [\frac{p_i}{p_j}]$$  
    iff the task $T_i$ is RM-schedulable
