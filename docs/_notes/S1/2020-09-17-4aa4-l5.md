Real-Time Scheduling
===

**Process**
- A program in execution
- An abstraction of a running system
- The logical unit of work scheduled by an OS
    - Processes are independent, cary considerable state information, have separate address spaces and interact through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms
- Program in virtual memory
    - **Stack**: Used to store function args and local variables, and the return address of functions that called the current function
    - **Heap**: Memory is dynamically located by system calls
    - **BSS segment**: uninitialized data
    - **Data segment**: initialized data
    - **Text**: Read-only region contaiing program instructions/code

- Difference of stack vs heap

- **Multiple Processes**
    - We could divide a program into multiple tasks by creating multiple processes from the `fork()` command
    - `fork()` creates a child process identical to its parent
    - `fork()` returns a **value of 0** to the child process and returns the **process ID** of the child process to the parent process

- **`fork()`**
    - Lots of overhead to create a new process, as everything is duplicated. Data space is not shared, so its harder to communicate
    - Variables initiated before `fork()` will be duplicated from the parent to the child process. After `fork()`, a branch is needed to separate the parent and the child
        - An example of this separation would be:  
        ```
        pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0)
            // Do child process work (fork process)
            ChildProcess();
        else
            // Do parent process work (main process)
            ParentProcess();
        ```
- **Theads**
    - Gives us a more efficient way to implement a task
    - Multiple subtasks can be implemented as separate streams in a single process
    - In the threads model, we break the memory space of a process into two parts:
        1. Contains the program-wide resources such as global data and program instructions/code
        2. Information pertaining to the execution state of control stream, such as the PC and the stack

    - Advantages of threads
        - Shared address space, communication between threads is more efficient
        - Context switching between threads in the same process typically faster than processes
        - Much quicker to make a thread than process
        - Supported by POSIX (Portable OS interface)
    - Disadvantages of threads
        - Need of synchronization, global variables are shared between threads, so any modification to these or shared variables could be disastrous (deadlock, crashes)
        - Less secure, many library functions are not thread safe, multiple threads trying to access the same function can throw an error
        - Lack of robustness, if one thread crashes, the whole application crashes
- Questions
    - Do we benefit using multi-threaded processes when it runs on a uniprocessor system?
        - Depends, speed of the program is either I/O bound or CPU bound
        - If I/O bound (in most cases), multiple threads will make the process more efficient (stop blocking from I/O finishing)
        - If CPU bound, multiple threads would not help on the uniprocessor system since it is already the bottleneck, and splitting it up won't make it any faster

Lab 2 Info
===
- User application cannot access the hardware directly
- OS is closest to the hardware
- Write device drivers on OS to communicate
- Lab 2 introduces you how to use kernel modules
- Learn how to communicate with NI myRIO using client
    - Use module commands discussed last lecture
    - User defined function names
    - Adding module information to codes
    - Passing params to a kernel module
- A VPN is required to do this, just look for McMaster VPN and you should be able to get it
    - There is also a virtual desktop tool that can be used
    - Choose the ITB 235 server
- Specific lab instructions can be found on Avenue
