Websockets and Bootstrap w/ React
===

Websockets w/ React
- There are libraries we can use with react, also using node.js
- Note that since the react app runs on server 3000, we will set the websockets server to run on 3001
- Everything else is pretty much the same as how you would use socket.io and react normally, just merge the two

Example Code for Websockets and React
- Note: There's a "ReactWebsocketsApp" zip file in lecture content that you can download, has all of the server data so you don't need to edit it
- Frontend code:  
```js
import io from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io('http://localhost:3001');

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor (props) {

        super(props);
        this.state = {messages: [], input: "", nextID: 0};

        socket.on('connect', function(){

            socket.on('chat message', function() {
                this.setState({
                    // Note the ... means make a new array, copy it, and add on this new data after
                    messages: [...this.state.messages, 
                                {msg: data, id: this.state.nextID}],
                    nextID: this.state.nextID + 1
                });
            // Note we need to bind the component to make this available to it
            }.bind(this));
        }.bind(this));
    }

    // Function called by button onClick
    submit()
    {

    }

    render() 
    {
        return (
            <div>
                <input type ="text" 
                    // Set onChange to set the state to the text box value
                    onChange={ (event) => this.setState({input: event.target.value}) } 
                    value={this.state.input} />
                <button onClick={this.submit.bind(this)}>Send</button>

                <ul>
                    {this.state.messages.map( ({msg.id}) => 
                        <li key={id}> {msg} </li>)};
                </ul>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default App;
```
- Furthermore, we can use bootstrap in this by getting it in npm, and using the following statements:  
```js
// Import bootstrap css
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
// Import any chosen components
import {Button, FormControl, ListGroup} from 'react-bootstrap';
// Then just use these components in place of your regular buttons/inputs/lists/etc
```
- Some further functionality like editing is given later in the lecture
