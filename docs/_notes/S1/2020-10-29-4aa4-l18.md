PCP Continuation

Recall...
- Resource Allocation Rule in PCP
    - If *R* is held by anotherr task, the request fails and the requesting task is blocked
    - If *R* is free, then
        1. If the requesting tasks priority is higher than the current priority ceiling of the system, *R* is allocated to it
        2. If the current priority of the requesting task is not higher than the priority ceiling of the system, the priority is denied and the task is blocked (avoid deadlock)
- Priority Inheritance Rule in PCP
    - When a task $T_1$ gets blocked by $T_2$, $T_2$ inherits the priority which is the ceiling of the allocated resource
    - $T_2$ executes at the inherited priority until it releases **ever resource** whose priority ceiling is equal or higher than the inherited priority of $T_2$, when it then returns to its original priority
- Example reviewed in lecture
