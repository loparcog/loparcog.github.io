Responsive Web Design
===

**What is Responsive Web Design?**
- A way of structuring your website so it will scale to the size of the screen (ie. desktop vs mobile version)
    - Avoid content being cut off, too small to read, etc.
- Common ways to do this:
    - Using display/float/width properties in CSS
        - Layout for elements based on screen size, can change whole display
    - Using CSS Flexbox
        - Container to resize items based on size
        - Will always shrink, but won't grow and stretch larger than original
    - Using CSS Grid Layout
        - Similar to flexbox, but things always scale to size, ie thing will grow/stretch larger
- Ideally use display/float/width, since wrapping and such can be used, more *universal* solution
