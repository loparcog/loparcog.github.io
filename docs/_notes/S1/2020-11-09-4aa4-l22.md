PID Controller

Proportional Control
- Proportional control action is obtained when we multiply the error signal by a constant gain, ie. our control input to the plant has a value proportional to the value of the error:  
$$K_pe(t) = K_p [u(t) - y(t)]$$  
AAA (img)
- Ex: Given a feedback system with $G_p(s) = \frac{1}{s+1}...
    - The closed loop transfer function is: 
    $$T(x) = \frac{G_p(s)}{1 + G_p(s)} = \frac{1}{s+2}$$  
    - Time constant is 1/2s  
    - The steady state output is:  
    $$y_SS(t) = \lim_{s \rightarrow 0} s T(s) u(s) = 1/2 s$$  
    - The steady state error is 1/2
- Adding a **proportional controller** to this system...
    - The closed loop transfer function is:  
    $$T(s) = \frac{K_p G_p}{1 + K_p G_p}$$  
    For $K_p = 9$, $T(s) = \frac{9}{s + 10}$, giving a steady state output of 0.9  
    - Steady state error has been changed to 0.1. amd $\tau = 0.1$
- Using an **integral control**, the closed loop transfer function is given as:  
$$T(s) = \frac{G_c G_p}{1 + G_c G_p} =\frac{K_l}{s^2 + s + K_l}$$  
    - This gives a steady state value of 1, with an error of 0
- We can combine these controllers to get a **proportional-integral controller (PI)**, giving the closed loop transfer function as:  
AAA (finish)
- Consider the **derivative control** of the first order system, making the closed loop transfer function:  
$$T(s) = \frac{G_c G_p}{1 + G_c G_p} = \frac{K_D s}$$  
AAA (finish)
- Second order system adds in the dampening effect, notified by $\zeta$
    - Increasing the dampening effect decreases the overshoot, but increases peak time

PID Controller
- PID is an abbreviation for Proportional/Integral/Derivative Control  
AAA (img)  
- Effects of PID Control
    - Proportional Gain: Steady state system error is reduced by increasing $K_p$  
    - Integral Gain: We can use integral action to reduce steady state error to 0, but the trade off is stability and dynamic performance
    - Derivative Gain: Settling/peak time and damping in our system is directly affected by our derivative gain
- In the time domain:  
$$u(t) = K_P e(t) + K_I \int_0^t e(n) dn + K_D \frac{de(t)}{dt}$$  
- For the **proportional part**:  
$$u(k) = K_P e(k)$$  
- For the **integral part**:  
$$\frac{du(t)}{dt} = K_I e(t) \rightarrow \frac{u(k) - u(k-1)}{T} - K_I e(t)$$  
AAA (finish)
- The **derivative part** approximates to:  
$$u(k) = \frac{K_D}{T} [e(k) - e(k-1)]$$  
- Therefore, the **PID controller** approximates to:  
AAA (finish)

Example of PD Controller
- Given $G_P(s) = \frac{1}{s(s+2)}$, and $G_c(s) = K(s+4)$, sketch the root locus for the closed loop feedback system. For what values of *K* (if any) is the system not stable?

    - SOLN:  
    The open loop transfer function is given as:  
    $$\frac{K(s+4)}{s(s+2)}$$  
    There are two poles and one finite zero, one infinite zero  
    The closed loop poles satisfy $s^2 + (K + 2)s + 4K = 0$, giving us:  
    $$s_{1,2} = \frac{-(K+2) \pm \sqrt{K^2 - 12K + 4}}{2}$$  
    At the crossing point of the root locus and real axis, the *K* value should be 11.657 and 0.343, because the *K* value should make $K^2 0 12K + 4 = 0$. So the crossing point should be $\frac{-(K+2)}{2}$, the *s* value should be -6.83 and -1.17 for two different *K* values  
    When $K \gt 0$, the root locus is on the left half of the plane. All *K* values make the system stable
