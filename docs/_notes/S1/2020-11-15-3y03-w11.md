Tests on the Mean of a Normal Distribution, Variance **Known**

Type II Error and Choice of Sample Size
- With the following test:  
$$H_0: \mu = \mu_0, H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$$  
suppose that the null hypothesis is false and that the true value of the mean is $\mu = \mu_0 + \delta$, say, where $\delta \gt 0$. Then when $H_1$ is true, the distribution of the test statistic $Z_0$ is:  
$$Z_0 \approx N \left(\frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sigma}, 1 \right)$$
- The probability of a Type II Error for two-sided test is given as:  
$$\beta = \Phi \left(z_{\alpha/2}-\frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right) - \Phi \left(-z_{\alpha/2}-\frac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)$$
- The appropriate sample size for a particular value of $\beta$ with a given $\alpha, \delta$ can also be found with (two- sided):  
$$n \approx \frac{(z_{\alpha/2} + z_\beta)^2 \sigma^2}{\delta^2}, \delta = \mu - \mu_0$$
- One-sided:  
$$n \approx \frac{(z_{\alpha} + z_\beta)^2 \sigma^2}{\delta^2}, \delta = \mu - \mu_0$$

Tests on the Mean of a Normal Distribution, Variance **Unknown**
- When *n* is large enough, the sample standard deviation *s* can be substituted for $\sigma$ in the test procedures with little effect. Thus, although we have given a test for the mean of a normal distribution with known $\sigma^2$, it can be easily converted into a large-sample test procedure for unknown $\sigma^2$. The large sample test relies on the **central limit theorem**
