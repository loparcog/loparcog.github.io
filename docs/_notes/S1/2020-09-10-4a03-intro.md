    - Will also be useful for getting a P.Eng

- Stage Six: Inquiry > 10%
- Stage Seven: Solution Proposal > 10%

Do Engineers Need Ethics?
- What do engineers do?
    - Engineers change society through products and projects they create, and the processes used to achieve them
- There is a Professional Engineers' Code of Ethics
    - Section 77 of the Regulation - O.Reg.941 states that you have a responsibility to the environment, to the public, and to your employer, to follow proper code and ethics

**Gamification**
- The "Code Red Region" is an area in Hamilton where neighbourhoods live with Third World health conditions and lifespans, despite being in a city with top teaching, hospitals, and in a country with universally funded health care
    - Despite Hamilton's 10yr initiative to improve the living standards of the region, the conditions have hardly changed
- Make a team of 4 people and make up a consulting engineering company that will offer proposals to Hamilton to solve the problems raised in the Code Red article
    - Key notes of the article in the slides
- Game will consist of 7 stages presented throughout the semester
    - Each stage has an assignment associated with it
    - While it's a team effort, each person has a chance to get individual points
    - **Points and marks are decoupled**
- Students will take on one of four roles in their group to take on throughout the project
    - TA's and the prof will be the counselors and mayor of Hamilton to act as judges
- Each team has three powerups that they can buy through points in the game, helping to challenge other teams and/or give power to your own team
- Again, **course grades not entirely influenced by total points**, but if you're doing good in points you're probably doing good in the assignments
- Look into "Gamification Stages" to get more information on the assignment
    - Need to make a contract and sign off with your group mates, along with your own bio-sheet (doesn't need to be factual, just needs to be there)

**The Art of Inquiry**
- What is inquiry?
    - A path to knowledge and understanding, based on asking questions for more information and getting to the bottom of things
    - Ideally begins with curiosity, questions, and doubts
- Why is it important to teach inquiry?
    - If this is embraced, it leads to life long learning
    - Inquiry is a natural activity but higher skills require developments
    - It is an art that requires practice
        - Stupid questions do actually exist, but this will help to learn how to ask a good quesiton
        - Likes to root itself in "why" questions, get to the root and reasoning of things
- What does inquiry involve?
    - Forming good questions
    - Identifying issues and anticipating possible findings
    - Looking for many forms of evidence
    - Interpreting and evaluating evidence and arguments
    - Arriving at well-reasoned conclusions
- Inquiry is a lot of back and forth from exploring research, asking questions, getting answers, and coming to your own conclusions
- What inquiry is not
    - Presenting descriptive information on a topic
    - Supporting a thesis by developing only one side of the issue
    - Offering a solution to a design problem as in a design project

**History of Engineers' Concern for Social Responsibility**
- Engineering is directly defined as the application of sceience for directly useful purposes, like construction, communication, etc.
    - The word comes from 'ingenious', and "brute force engineering" has been around for a long time
- Common process of Nature -> Engineering -> Devices
    - Everything was based on experience, trial and error, and slowly work to some sort of equation or solution to implement
- The nature of the profession is that you
    - Hold specialized skills
    - Are self regulated
    - Are a guardian of public welfare
- NOTE: A profession is NOT a job! A profession is a set of specialized skills, relating to different jobs/"task-doers"
    - Engineering is a professions, accounting is a profession
- Social responsibility is show in a profession through
    - Restriction of membership
    - Setting standards
    - Code of acceptable practice
        - Code of Ethics
        - Code of Conduct (separate from ethics)
    - Carry out discipline
    - Formation of special groups
- Engineering wasn't always a profession, used to be apprentice-based, passing knowledge down from one another
    - Military engineer was first, responsibility being obedience
- Civilian engineering followed behind, wokring directly for government since there were no companies for this yet. This would be for
    - Primarily public works
    - Roads, water supply, sanitation
    - Still under authority of the state
- Corperations started coming around after the industrial revolution, true private business for the first time
    - Other branches of engineering opened up here, like mechanical, electrical, mining, materials, chemical, etc.
    - Engineers now in obedience to corporate employer
- There were only 30 engineers in 1816 (USA), rose to 2000 by 1850
- Engineers started to argue that they are a profession, the same way that doctors and lawyers argued it
    - There was a need for autonomy, implying that there's a responsibility to the public
    - Wanted to separate from the government since not all engineers worked in the government
- Engineers were held to high esteem, primary agents of technological change
    - Main force in human progress, birthed technocracy (politics backed by science and tech members)
- Tension began in early 1900s for obedience to employer vs responsibility to society
    - Who's liable for the condition of a good you buy? The employer? The engineer? The distributor?
- How did corporations fight back? (They don't like social responsibility, gets in the way of money)
    - Engineers promoted into management
    - Corporations remove sponsorship
    - Censuring of reports
        - ie. Smoking is bad? No, we won't let that out, people don't need to know
    - Codes
        - Unethical to criticize other engineers, unethical to discuss issues with the public
        - The 'earliest' codes put loyalty to the employer
        - New codes state that oblication is to social welfare
- Some events leading up to the 1980's
    - Manhattan Project
        - Creation of nuclear bomb
    - Silent Spring
        - Book, birth of environmentalism
        - Research of bird migration, always go to same spot to look at birds, saw fewer and fewer births happening, until no birds, many dead eggs from nests
        - A pesticide was bioaccumulating in birds, affecting bird eggs, causing chicks to die on birth
    - Ford Pinto
        - Poorly designed car leading to many deaths at minor fender benders
    - 3 Mile Island
        - Worst nuclear accident in the US, partial meltdown
- 1970, Milton Friedman, "Business has no social responsibility other than increase profits and refrain from engaging in deception and fraud. **When business seeks to maximize profits, it almost always incidentally does what is good for society**"
    - This is the funniest shit I have ever read I just wanted to highlight this
- What are ethics?
    - The rules and ideals for human behaviour, tells us "what we ought to do"
