Request Replication
===

Why Replication?
- Reduce latency
- Have already looked at one approach: JSQ
- Another option: redundancy
- Server-side variability (think of JSQ in non-exponential setting)

Replication Model
- Send multiple requests simultaneously, kill when one completes
- Can consider other models

Pros and Cons
- Data must be replicated
- Overhead of killing jobs
- Resource wastage?
- Do not need to know queue lengths (compared with JSQ)
- Has been shown to improve performance, example in Google's BigTable

N Model
- Two servers, rates $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$
- Arrivals to node 2, rate $\lambda_A$
- Replicated arrivals (both nodes), rate $\lambda_R$
    - Arrivals are all exponentially distributed

CTMC Model
- What to choose for state
- Number of jobs at each class (*A* and *R*) at each queue?
    - Why doesn't this work?
    - Ex. 3 *R* jobs at queue 1, 3 *R* and 2 *A* jobs at queue 2  
    Represented by (# of *R* jobs, # of *A* jobs) = (3,2)  
    This state does not tell us what type of job is being processed at queue 2
- New proposed state: simply keep a central queue of jobs in system, ordered with respect to their arrival times
- (Most recent, ..., least recent)  
Start with example queue $(R, A, A, R)$
    - With $\lambda_R \to (R, R, A, A, R)$
    - With $\lambda_A \to (A, R, A, A, R)$
    - With $ \mu_1 + \mu_2 \to (R, A, A)$
- Another example queue would be $(R, A, R, A)$
    - With $\lambda_R \to (R, R, A, R, A)$  
    - With $\lambda_A \to (A, R, A, R, A)$
    - With $\mu_1 \to (R, A, A)$
    - With $\mu_2 \to (R, A, R)$

Main Theorem
- The steady-state probability of being in state $(c_n, c_n-1, ..., c_1)$ is:  
$$\pi_{(c_n, ..., c_1)} = C_N \left(\frac{\lambda_A}{\mu_2}\right)^{a_0} \left( \frac{\lambda_R}{\mu_1 + \mu_2} \right)^r \left(\frac{\lambda_A}{\mu_1 + \mu_2} \right)^a_1$$
- $a_0$: Number of class *A* jobs before the first class *R* job
- $a_1$: Number of class *A* jobs after the first class *R* job
- $r$: Number of class *R* jobs
- $$C_N = \frac{(\mu_2 - \lambda_A)(\mu_1 + \mu_2 - \lambda_A + \lambda_R)}{\mu_2(\mu_1 + \mu_2 - \lambda_A)}$$

Results
1. Response time of class *R* jobs is $Exp(\mu_1 + \mu_2 - \lambda_A - \lambda_R)$
2. Complete distributional results for both types

Insights
- Compare with two M/M/1's one for each class, set $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ and $\lambda_A = \lambda_R$
- Class *R* improves $E[T]$ by a factor of two
- Class *A* hurt by up to 50% (often less than that)
- If class *A* becomes redundant, class *R* is unaffected, of course improvement for class *A* (system becomes an M/M/1)
- Compare to JSQ: redundancy better, often for both classes (why?)
