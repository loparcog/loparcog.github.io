Multiserver Systems
===

Review
- We've discussed a few types of server and queue systems in last lecture
    1. k queues and k server systems
    2. 1 queue and 1 server systems
    3. 1 queue and k server systems
- We came to the conclusion that 3 is preferred over 1
    - System 1 has the case where servers are sitting idle and the others have more than one job, where System 3 cannot run into that
- What about 2 vs 3?
    - Only difference is instead of having k servers like in 3, 2 has one server working at $k\mu$ capacity
    - 2 is preferred since the maximum processing speed of 3 is $k*\mu$, when all servers are running, but the minimum processing time for system 2 is $k*\mu$
- This gives us the order:  
    $$S_2 \gt S_3 \gt S_1$$

*k* M/M/1 (1) vs M/M/1 (2)
- For the fast M/M/1 system and one of the *k* slow M/M/1 queues, the number in system is the same, as both the arrival rate and processing rate are scaled up by a factor of *k* in the fast M/M/1 system  
$$E[T^{(1)}] = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda/k} = \frac{k}{k\mu - \lambda}$$  
$$E[T^{(2))}] = \frac{1}{k\mu - \lambda}$$
    - Note, although this is good in theory, this is not good in practice. Replacing *k* servers with one server would be exponentially expensive, if possible, and would create a lot of heat and more issues. If this server went down, this can become a much larger issue than just one of the *k* servers going down

M/M/1 (2) vs M/M/k (3)
- For the M/M/k system:  
$$E[N_Q] = E[N_Q | \text{queueing}] P_Q$$  
(The expected number in queue is the expected number in queue given that jobs are queueing multiplied by the probability of queueing)
$$E[N_Q] = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} P_Q$$
$$E[T] = \frac{1}{\lambda}P_Q\frac{\rho}{1-\rho} + \frac{1}{\mu}$$
$$\frac{E[T^{(3)}]}{E[T^{(2)}]} = \frac{\frac{1}{\lambda}P_Q\frac{\rho}{1-\rho} + \frac{1}{\mu}}{\frac{1}{\lambda}\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}}$$  
$$= P_Q + \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$$  
$$= P_Q + k(1-\rho)$$  
- Note the following:
    1. $\rho \approx 0$ gives $P_Q \approx 0$, so the M/M/1 is *k* times faster
    2. $\rho \approx 1$ gives $P_Q \approx 1$, so the two systems perform the same

Capacity Provisioning
- For an M/M/k system:  
$$E[T_Q] = \frac{1}{\lambda} P_Q \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$$  
where as a reminder, $\rho = \lambda/h\mu$
- $$E[T_Q] = E[T_Q | delayed]P_Q + E[T_Q|not delayed](1-P_Q)$$
AAA (finish equations)
- Expected waiting time of those jobs that are delayed:  
$$\frac{E[T_Q]}{P_Q} = \frac{1}{\lambda} \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} = \frac{1}{k \mu(1 - \rho)}$$  
- Fix $\rho$ and this becomes a decreasing function of k
- Insight: For high values of system utilization, $\rho$, jobs will not necessarily suffer, provided that there are sufficiently many servers
- Intuition: Even at high utilizations, as the number of servers grows, the probability that there is a free server increases ($P(idle) * k$)
- Capacity Provisioning Rule
    - How many servers are needed in an M/M/k to keep the probability of queueing below a certain level?
    - Definition: For an M/M/k queue with arrival rate $\lambda$ and processing rate $\mu$, the quantity $R = \lambda/\mu$ is equivalently:  
    1. Minimum number of servers needed to keep system stable
    2. Expected number of busy servers
    3. Expected number of jobs being processed
    - If R large, then $k = R + \sqrt{R}$ yields $P_Q$ below 20%
    - What is the probability of more than $R + \sqrt{R}$ jobs in M/M/$\inf$?
    - We know that the limiting distribution is a Poisson distribution, with mean *R*

M/M/$\inf$ Lower Bound
- For *R* large, $Poisson(R)$ will be approximated well by $Normal(R,R)$
- Thus, the probability of more than $R + \sqrt{R}$ is the probability that the $Normal(R,R)$ is more than one standard deviation above its mean
- Probability that $Normal(0,1)$ exceeds its mean by one standard deviation is $1 - \phi(1) \approx 0.16$
- M/M/$\inf$ is a lower bound, as the fraction of time an M/M/$\inf$ has more than *x* servers busy is lower than the fraction of time that an M/M/k has more than *x* servers busy

Capacity Provisioning Theorem
- **NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THEOREM**
- Given an M/M/k with arrival rate $\lambda$ and server speed $\mu$ and $R=\lambda/\mu$, where *R* is large, let $k_a^*$ denote the least number of servers needed to ensure that $P_Q^M/M/k \lt a$ AAA(finish)
