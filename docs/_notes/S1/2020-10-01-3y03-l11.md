Continuation of CDF
===

Recall Ex:  
$X ~ N(5.75, (0.35)^2)$, find a symmetric interval such that 99% of the time, the transfer speed is in that interval?
- SOLN:  
$P(\mu - a \leq Z \leq \mu + a) = 0.99)$  
Note, $\mu$ of standard normal random variable is 0. Our random variable is normal, but not standard, so we need to plug in our values:  
$\mu$ of $N(5.75, (0.35)^2) = 5.75$  
$P(5.75 - a \leq x \leq 5.75 + a) = 0.99$  
$= P(x \leq 5.75 + a) - P(x \leq 5.75 -a) = 0.99$  
Let $Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$  
$P(Z \leq \frac{5.75 + a - 5.75}{0.35}) - P(Z \leq \frac{5.75 - a - 5.75}{0.35}) = 0.99$  
$P(Z \leq \frac{a}{0.35}) - P(Z \leq \frac{-a}{0.35}) = 0.99$  
This gives us the range on the distribution, getting us both ends of the graph. We can swap these numbers to get:  
$P(Z \leq \frac{a}{0.35}) - (1 - P(Z \leq \frac{-a}{0.35})) = 0.99$  
$2P(Z \leq \frac{a}{0.35}) - 1 = 0.99$  
$P(Z \leq \frac{a}{0.35}) = \frac{1.99}{2} = 0.995$  
Now that it is in a standard normal variable representation, we can use the graph to get our answer:  
$\frac{a}{0.35} = 2.5 + 0.08$  
$a = 0.903$  
Now we need to plug this back in to get the interval  
$[5.75 - 0.903, 5.75 + 0.903]$  
$[4.847, 6.653]$
