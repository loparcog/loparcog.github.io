Creating Interactive Web Frontends
===

Handling I/O / Event Driven programming
- User input handled through JS events
- Page output handled by JS DOM manipulation
    - Manipulating HTML elements through JS
- Flow of execution is determined by events, handled by *event handlers*
    - The browser is constantly checking for events on the *event/main loop*
    - When an event is triggered, if an event handler exists, the control will be passed over to it
- Once an event happens, the Document Object Model (DOM) is manipulated through JS
    - DOM is the tree structure of objects that the browser constructs while rendering the webpage
- Some examples are given through the tutorial

Some JS Notes
- Can use [queryselectorall](https://www.w3schools.com/JSREF/met_document_queryselectorall.asp) to select objects in the same class/tag to make a multiple object activator
