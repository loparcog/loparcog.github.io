Mapping Stability Region from s-Plane to z-Plane
- From continuous control, we know that: the region of stability is the left half of the s-plane. We know how to transform $G(s)$ to $G(z)$, where does the region of stability lie on the z-plane?
- By definition $z = e^{sT}$. Let $s = \alpha + j \omega$, then:  
$$z = e^{sT} = e^{T(\alpha + j \omega)} = e^{\alpha T} e^{j \omega T}$$  
$$z = e^{\alpha T}(cos(\omega T) + j*sin(\omega T)) = e^{\alpha T} \angle \omega T$$
- Each region on the s-plane is put into a corresponding region on the z-plane
- We assume $s = \alpha + j \omega$
    - If $\alpha$ is positive, $e^{\alpha T} \gt 1$. Thus, the points on the positive real axis of the s-plane are points outside the unit circle on the z-plane
    - If $\alpha$ is negative, $e^{\alpha T} \lt 1$. Thus, the points on the negative real axis of the s-plane are points inside the unit circle on the z-plane
    - Points on the $j \omega$ axis, $\alpha$ has 0 values, so $e^{\alpha T} = 1$. Thus, points on the $j \omega$ axis of the s-plane map into points on the unit circle of the z-plane

Stability of a Digital Control System
- The system is **stable** if all poles of the closed loop transfer function are inside the unit circle on the z-plane
- The system is **unstable** if any of the poles are outside the unit circle, and/or more than one pole is on the unit circle
- The system is **marginally stable** if one of the poles is on the unit circle and all other poles are inside the unit circle
- Pole values can change for different values of *T*, making the system only stable in a certain range of values of *T*

Root Locus in Z-Plane
- Determines the location of roots of the characteristic equation of a closed loop control system as the overall system gain (often denoted by *K*) varies
- Steps to plot closed-loop poles:
    1. Derive the open loop function $K \bar{GH}$
    2. Factor the numerator and denominator to get the open loop zeros and poles
    3. Plot the roots of $1 + K \bar{GH} = 0$ into z-Plane as *K* varies
    - Note that while construction rules for the z-Plane are identical with those for the s-Plane, **the interpretation is different**
- Consider the following system:

- Steps to plot the root locus for the above system:
    1. Start at $z=1$ and $z=0.368$, and terminate at $z=-0.717$ and $z=\infty$
    2. Break-away points or break-in points can be found at  
    $$\frac{d}{dz} G(z) = 0$$  
    which occurs at $z = 0.64$ and $z = -2.08$
    3. Find the corresponding *K* values for these points
    - You can find the value of *K* which yields marginal stability by setting $z=1$ and solving
