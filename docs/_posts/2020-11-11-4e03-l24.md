Model Analysis and Reliabilities
===

Batch Means
- Given one run with observations $(x_i)$
- Transient removal from first *k* observations
- Break up the remaining $n-k$ observations into *s* batches of size *r*, where $s = (n-k)/r$ is integral
- Let $Y_j, j=1,...,s$ be the average of the *j*th batch:  
$$Y_j = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{i = k+(j-1)r+1}^{k+jr} x_i, j=1,...,s$$
- Treat $Y_j$ as if they were independent and construct the appropriate confidence interval
- CSUM uses batch means
    - Batch size is chosen automatically
    - Can perform run length control - continue to run simulation until a desired condition on the computed confidence interval(s) hold
    - Typically run until width of confidence interval is a certain percentage of the average
- C code example

Model Validation
- Beyond logical correctness, we would like to check that the simulation is implementing the correct model
1. **Expert intuition** - May want a domain expert to validate your input and/or output. Somewhat ad hoc, but can be very effective
2. **Real system measurements** - This is the most reliable/preferred way. However, may be problematic, as the real system may not exist, or measurements may be too expensive to carry out
3. **Theoretical results** - Suppose that we are simulating a system that cannot be exactly analyzed. If assumptions are made, the model may become tractable ,so one could use this for *partial* validation


Time-Independent Reliabilities
- System composed of components such that when we examine the system, component *i* is working with probability of $R_i$ (independent of time)
- Components fail independently of other components
- Components in Series
    - The system is working if *all* of the components are working
    - Overall system reliability:  
    $$R = R_1 * R_2 * ... * R_n$$
- Components in Parallel
    - The system is working if *at least one* of the components is working
    - In other words, system is failed if *all* components are failed:  
    $$1 - R = (1- R_1)(1-R_2) ... (1-R_n)$$  
    $$R = 1 - (1- R_1)(1-R_2) ... (1-R_n)$$  
- Triple Modular Redundancy
    - System consists of three components
    - Each component has same reliability $R$
    - Components fail independently
    - Here:  
    $$R_{TMR} = R^3 + \binom{3}{2} R^2(1-R)$$
- General Systems
    - Series/parallel combinations of components
    - Other structures in the system as well
    - Can be analyzed using **reliability block diagrams/fault trees**
- Redundancy
    - Consider a number of components in a series
    - Add a redundant component in parallel with one component, commonly on the least reliable
    - For example, $R_1 = 0.95, R_2 = 0.9, R_3 = 0.95$, this gives a base reliability $R=0.81225$
    - For parallel with components 1 or 3:  
    $$R = (0.95)(0.9)(1-(1-0.95)^2) = 0.8529$$
    - For parallel with component 2:  
    $$R = (0.95)^2(1-(1-0.9)^2) = 0.8935$$
    - In fact, improving component 2 is almost as good as improving both components 1 and 3 (where $R=0.8955$)

Time-Dependent Reliabilities
- Previous notion does not include element of time
- How long does a system operate before failing? Can a system become more/less likely to fail as time progresses?
- Lifetime
    - *X* is a random variable that represents the lifetime of a component/system
    - *X* has distribution $F(x)$ and density $f(x)$
    - $f(t) \delta t$ is approximately the probability that a failure occurs in the interval $(t, t + \delta t)$
    - Would like to know the probability that a failure occurs in a (small) time interval, given that failure has not yet occurred
    - Make this precise using conditional probability
