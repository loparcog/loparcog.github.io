System Response for First and Second Order Systems
===

Time Constraint of First Order Systems
- First order system:
AAA (img)
- The output of a general first order system to a step input results in a transfer function:  
$$Y(s) = X(s) G(s) = \frac{a}{s(s+a)}$$ 
- This results in a time domain output given by:  
$$y(t) = 1-e^{-at}$$  
where parameter *a* is the only parameter that affects the output
- $$t = \frac{1}{a}, y(t) = 0.63$$  
$1/a$ is the time constant of the response, and is the time it takes for the step response to rise to 63% of its final value

Response in Time Domain
- **Rise Time ($T_r$)**: Time for the waveform to go from 0.1 to 0.9 of its final value. For first order systems, $T_r = \frac{2.2}{a}$
- **Settling Time ($T_s$)**: Time for the response to reach and stay within 2% of its final value. For first order systems, $T_s = \frac{4}{a}$

In-Class Question
- The figure shows the response of the three first-order systems having transfer function $\frac{K}{s+a}$, where the values of *K* are different for the three systems  
AAA(img)
    1. Which of the three curves (1,2,3) represent a system with the lowest time constraint?  
    SOLN: 3
    2. The bog dots on the three graphs represent the time when the response settles within 2% of the final value. Find the transfer function for each of the three systems  
    SOLN:
    We're mainly looking for the values of *a*. We know that $T_s = 4/a$, and we get from the graph that $T_s = 7.8, 3.9, 0.8$, so the *a* values are then 0.5, 1, and 5, respectively.  
    The steady state value of each system is 1, so $K=a$, and therefore, the transfer functions are:  
    $$\frac{0.5}{s+0.5}$$  
    $$\frac{1}{s+1}$$  
    $$\frac{5}{s+5}$$

Second Order Systems
- Most real world systems are not first order systems, a general second order system is defined by the transfer function:  
$$G(s) = \frac{b}{s^2 + as + b}$$  
- Furthermore, the poles of the transfer function can be found as:
$$s_1, s_2 = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2}$$
    - There is a special case when $a=0$, and the transfer function is $G(s) = \frac{b}{s^2 + b}$. The poles will have only an imaginary part $\pm jw$, and by definition, the **natural frequency** $w_n = \sqrt{b}$ is the frequency of oscillation of this system

Damping Coefficient ($\zeta$)
- The complex poles have a real part $\sigma = -a / 2$
- The magnitude of $\sigma$ is called the **exponential decay frequency**, and $w_n$ is the **natural frequency**
- We define the **Damping Ratio/Coefficient $\zeta$** as:  
$$\zeta = \frac{\text{Exponential decay frequency}}{\text{Natural frequency}}$$  
$$= \frac{\sigma}{w_n} = \frac{a/2}{w_n}$$
- This also gives us:  
$$a = 2 \zeta w_n$$

General Second Order Transfer Function
- The general second order transfer function is written as:
$$G(s) = \frac{w_n^2}{s^2 + 2 \zeta w_n s + w_n^2}$$  
$$s_1, s_2 = - \zeta w_n \pm w_n \sqrt{\zeta^2 -1}$$
- Observations of $\zeta$ given as follows:
    - Two imaginary poles @ $\pm j \omega_n: \zeta = 0$ (undampened)  
    Natural response given as $c(t) = A cos(\omega_n t - \theta)$
    - To complex poles at $\sigma_d \pm j \omega_d: 0 \lt \zeta \lt 1$ (underdamped)  
    Natural response given as $c(t) = A e^{(-\sigma_d)t} cos(\omega_d t - \theta)$, where $w_d = w_n \sqrt{1-\zeta^2}$
    - Two real poles at $\sigma_1: \zeta = 1$ (critically damped)  
    Natural response given as $c(t) - Kte^{\sigma_1 t}$
    - Two real poles at $\sigma_1, \sigma_2: \zeta \gt 1$ (overdamped)  
    Natural response given as $c(t) = K(e^{\sigma_1 t} + e^{\sigma_2 t})$
