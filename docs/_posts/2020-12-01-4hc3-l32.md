Exam Review
===

Info
- Two time slots
    - Friday, December 11th 12:30PM - 3:00PM (Original)
    - Saturday, December 12th 12:30AM - 3:00AM
- 2 1/2 hours to complete, 30min of grace time for finishing up
- Will be a quiz on avenue
- Example exam is on avenue
- Academic dishonesty obviously applies, no group work, can use notes though
- Content submitted by you needs to be written by you during the exam
    - Don't copy off stackoverflow
    - Avenue code is fair game though
- Types of questions:
    - Design an interface, possibly include a prototype, making and explaining any design decisions
        - Can just take a picture of a sketch/wireframe
    - Could be asked to write code to solve problems w/ technologies we discussed in lecture
    - Could be asked opinion on a subject in HCI, and to justify based on what was taught in the course
        - Justification is where the marks are
    - Could be asked short-answer questions related to HCI theory taught in course
        - Can involve creating items (task hierarchy, usability test instructions) or analyzing items, or other writing formats
- Send any information through Avenue Mail Service
- No proctoring because that's a mess
- **Don't worry to much about small code errors or exact wireframes**. Get the idea down, and if you have time feel free to go iron out small errors
