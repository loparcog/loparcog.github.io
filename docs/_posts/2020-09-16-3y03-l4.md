Further Probability Examples

Choose/Permutation Questions
- Ex1: 75 semi-conductors, 70 standard and 5 not
    - Q: Select 3 samples  
    SOLN:  
    Common sense: assume the 75 semi-conductors are numbered ( 1, 2, 3, ..., 75, where 70-75 are non-standard)  
    Since it is an unordered arrangement, the group 3, 1, *75* is the same as 1, 3, *75*, since there are no differences between the semi-conductors in each group  
    (This is just an explanation for a question last lecture, look there for the full solution)
- Ex2: Flip a coin (S = {$H, T$}). Show that the coin is fair ($P(H) = P(T) = \frac{1}{2}$)
    - SOLN  
    The axiom of probability says that:
    1. Each probability is >/= 0
    2. The sum of the weights is = 1
    - Therefore, we can get that  
    $P(H) + P(T) = 1$  
    $P(H) = P(T)$
        - Solving these equations gets us the line that $P(H) = P(T) = \frac{1}{2}$
- Ex3: A heating system has the following probabilities for a shutdown (E = electrical failure, G = gas leak):
    | $E$ | $E'$ |
$G$ | 32  | 5|
$G'$| 21  | 12|  
What is the probability of...
    - a) $P(E)$  
    SOLN:  
    This probability is the total chance of E happening (number of shutdown caused by E), which would be E over the full total (number of total shutdowns)  
    $P(E) = \frac{32+21}{32+21+5+12}$  
    **$ = \frac{53}{70}$**
    - b) $P(E \cap G)$  
    SOLN:  
    This probability is the chance of E and G both happening in a shutdown. This would just be the cell with E and G, which is 32  
    **$ P(E \cap G) = \frac{32}{70}$**
    - c) $P(E \cup G')$  
    SOLN:  
    This probability is the total chance of a shutdown caused by E or not by G (NOTE: Do not count overlap, so we're really looking for $P(E) + P(G) - P(E \cap G')$)  
    $P(E \cup G') = \frac{(32 + 21) + (12)}{70}$  
    **$ = \frac{65}{70}$**
    - d) $P(E \| G)$  
    SOLN:  
    What is the equation for conditional probability anyways?  
    $P(E \| G) = \frac{P(E \cap G)}{P(G)}$  
    We can now plug in values to this equation and solve our problem  
    $ = \frac{32/70}{37/70}$  
    **$ = \frac{32}{37}$**
- Ex4: Circuits and reliability. Take a circuit with probability that parts D1 and D2 (in series) will work as $D_1 = 0.8$, $D_2 = 0.9$. What's the probability that the system will work?  
SOLN:  
$P(\text{system function}) = P(D_1 \cap D_2)$  
NOTE: D1 is independent with D2 (in series, not in parallel), which means the intersection would be:  
$= P(D_1) x P(D_2)$  
$= 0.8 x 0.9$  
**$= 0.72$**

- Ex5: New circuit, with working probability $D_1 = 0.8$, $D_2 = 0.9$, but the parts are in parallel. What's the probability the system would work?  
SOLN:  
NOTE: Since it is in parallel, now either one just needs to work, making this a union example
$P(\text{system function}) = P(D_1 \cup D_2)$  
$= P(D_1) + P(D_2) - P(D_1 \cap D_2)$  
$= 0.8 + 0.9 - 0.72$  
**$= 0.98$**

- Ex6: Newer circuit, with top in series as $D_1 = 0.8$, $D_2 = 0.9$, and the bottom in series as $D_3 = 0.7$. What is the probability the system would work?  
SOLN:  
$P(\text{system function}) = P(\text{upper} \cup \text{lower})$  
$= P(\text{upper}) + P(\text{lower}) - (P(\text{upper}) x P(\text{lower}))$  
$= 0.72 + 0.7 - (0.72 x 0.7)$  
**$= 0.916$**
