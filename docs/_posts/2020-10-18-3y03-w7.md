Independent Random Variables
- Recall two events $A,B$ are said to be independent if:  
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$$
    - This concept will motivate a definition of independence for CRV's
- Let $X,Y$ be CRV's with joint pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$. We say that $X,Y$ are *independent* iff:  
$$f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)$$  
where $f_X$ and $f_Y$ are the marginal density functions of $X$ and $Y$
- If $X, Y$ are independent and jointly distributed on a region $R \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, then $R$ must be rectangular ($R = I_1 * I_2$ for intervals $I_1, I_2$) (Also note the converse is false). In this case:  
$$1 = \int \int_{I_1 * I_2} f_{X,Y}(x,y) dx dy$$  
$$= (\int_{I_1} f_X(x) dx)(\int_{I_2} f_Y(y) dy)$$

Covariance
- Suppose $X,Y$ are CRV's that are jointly distributed with joint pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$
- For any "nice" function $h(x,y)$, $h(X,Y)$ is a random variable, and we have the expected value of $h(X,Y)$ is:  
$$E(h(X,Y)) = \int \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} h(x,y) f_{X,Y}(x,y) dx dy$$
    - We can use this to construct a measure of *linear relationship* between $X$ and $Y$
- Given $X, Y$ CRV's with joint pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$, the **covariance** of $X$ and $Y$ is defined to be:  
$$\sigma_{XY} := E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)$$
- Note that if X and Y are independent, then:  
$$E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)$$
- In general, if $X,Y$ are independent, then $\sigma_{XY} = 0$
    - If the covariance is 0 though, it does not imply $X,Y$ are independent, only that there is no linear relationship

Correlation
- The **correlation** between random variables $X,Y$, denoted as $\rho_{X,Y}$, is:  
$$\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}} = \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$$
- For any two random variables $X,Y$, $-1 \leq \rho_{XY} \leq 1$
- If the points in the joint probability distribution of $X,Y$ that receive positive probability tend to fall along a line of positive/negative slope, $\rho_{XY}$ is near 1
- Two random variables with nonzero correlation are said to be correlated
- If $X,Y$ are independent random variables, then:  
$$\rho_{XY} = \sigma_{XY} = 0$$
