Priority Inversion
===

Review
- Among CE, RM, DM, EDF, which are static priorty schedulers?
    - RM and DM are static priority schedulers, whereas CE does not have a priority, and EDF is dynamic, based on absolute deadlines
- Wihch of the above is the optimal scheduler for real-time applications? What is the drawback of it?
    - EDF is the optimal one, but the priority is not always able to be predicted

Critical Sections
- When two ore more processes are competing to use the same resource - **race condition/conflict**
- Resource can be used by one task at a time - **mutual exclusion**
- Use of a resource cannot be interrupted - **serially reusable**
- Code that interacts with serially reusable resources - **critical section**
- We can avoid race conditions by making sure that no two processes/threads enter their **critical sections** at the same time
    - What tools to do this>
- **Mutex**: At most, one process can hold it
    - Locking thread gets ownership of the mutex when first locked
    - Only an owner process can unlock a mutex
    - Can cause issues with **deadlock** though, if both task A and B try to access resources C and D, but each one has the lock for each other
        - Would create infinite wait, cannot solve without unlock or restart
- Resource Access Control
    - One processor
    - *n* serially reusable resources $R_1, R_2, ..., R_n$, typically used by processes in a mutually exclusive manner **without preemption**
    - A resource, once allocated to a job, cannot be used by another job until the previous job frees it
    - Resources that can be used by more than one jobs at the same time (eg. files) are modeled as a resource type that has many units, each used in a mutually exclusive manner
- Mutual Exclusion and Critical Sections
    - When a job wants to use $k_i$ units of resource $R_i$, it executes a lock to request them, denoted by $L(R_i; k_i)$. An unlock is denoted by $U(R_i; k_i)$
    - In case $R_i$ has just one unit, a simpler notation $L(R_i), U(R_i)$ is used
    - The segment of a job that begins at a lock and ends at a matching unlock is called a critical section, denoted by $[R; t]$
    - A critical section that is not included in any other critical section is called the **outermost critical section**
- Problem caused by Resource Contention
    - **Resource Contention** is multiple tasks trying to access the same resources
    - Consider 3 tasks: $T_1(6; 7; 5; 8), T_2(2; 15; 7; 15), T_3(0; 18; 6; 18)$, assume EDF scheduling algorithm
    - For the first jobs in the tasks, $T_1$ has the highest priority and $T_3$ the lowest priority
    - If we do not consider resource contention, what is a feasbile schedule (assuming the tasks are preemptable)?
        - $T_3, T_2, T_1, T_2, T_3$
    - What happens if the tasks $T_1, T_2, T_3$ each have critical sections $[R; 2], [R; 4], [R; 4]$ after time unitis 2, 2, 1, respectively
        - Would let tasks preempt when others are in their critical sections, but would need to go back to the original task before starting their own critical sections
        - If no critical sections are currently running, the task that reaches the critical section first will start
        - If the critical section is **released** and currently >= 2 tasks are waiting, the task with the highest priority will start
- Priority Inversion
    - This is because even if the tasks are preemptable, resources are allocated on a nonpreemptive basis
    - This phenomenon is called **priority inversion** (see lecture notes for graph)
    - Sources of priority inversion
        - Access shared resources guarded by mutex/semaphores
        - Access non-preemptive subsystems
    - Can also result in **timing anomalies**, meaning some takss may not be able to meet their deadlines following the regular scheduling
- Note: priority inversion may be unbounded
    - Without a good resource access control protocol, duration of a priority inversion may be infinite

Priority Inversion Solutions
- Non-Preemptive Critical Section Protocol (NPCS)
    - Schedule all critical sections non-preemptively
    - While a task holds a resource, it executes at a priority higher than the priority of all tasks
    - In general, a higher priority task is blocked only when some lower priority job is in critical section
    - Once the blocking critical section completes, no lower priority task can get the processor and acquire any resource until the higher priority task completes
    - In original case, deadlines of $T_1, T_2$ are missed, due to $T_3$ critical section
- Priority Inheritance
    - The priority of the task that is in the critical section inherits the priority of a higher priority task when the higher priority task requests the resource
