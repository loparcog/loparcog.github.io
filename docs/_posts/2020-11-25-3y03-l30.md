Hypothesis Testing Pt 3
===

AAA (check over first 10m of lecture)

From last lecture...
Ex1: Two machines produce steel rods whose diameter is normally distributed with unknown variance, but we know that $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma^2$.  
Machine 1 has a sample of 15 rods with $\bar{x}_1 = 8.73$ and $s_1^2 = 0.35$.  
Machine 2 has a sample of 17 rods with $\bar{x}_2 = 8.68$ and $s_2^2 = 0.4$.  
Test the claim that the machine 1 a nd 2 produce rods with different mean diameters with $\alpha = 0.05$
- SOLN:  
Step 1: Define what your null hypothesis is:  
$$H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0, H_1: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$$  
Step 2: Compute $S_P$:  
$$S_P = \frac{n_1 - 1}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} S_1^2 + \frac{n_2 - 1}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} s_2^2$$  
$$= \frac{15 - 1}{15 + 17 - 2}(0.35) + \frac{17-1}{15+17-2}(0.4)$$  
$$S_P = 0.37667$$  
Step 3: Calculate the mean range:  
$$\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 = 8.73 - 8.68 = 0.05$$  
This lets us know that we need a p-value between -0.05 and 0.05  
Step 4: Calculate the p-value:
$$p-value = P((\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \gt 0.05 \text{ or } \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 \lt -0.05) \text{ and } \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0)$$  
$$= P(\frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{S_P \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}} \gt \frac{0.05 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{S_P \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}}) + P(\frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{S_P \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}} \lt \frac{-0.05 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{S_P \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}})$$  
Note that $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$, so that term cancels out. We are then left with:  
$$P(T_0 \gt \frac{0.05}{S_P \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}}) + P(T_0 \lt \frac{-0.05}{S_P \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}})$$  
$$=P(T_0 \gt 0.37472) + P(T_0 \lt -0.37472)$$  
We can now use the t-distribution table to calculate these values, but first we need the degree of freedom, calculated through $n_1 + n_2 - 2$ when $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma^2$:  
$$D.O.F = 15+17 - 2 = 30$$  
Getting values from the table, we get 0.37472 is between 0.256 and 0.683 in the table, meaning $P(T_0 \gt 0.37472)$ is between 0.4 and 0.25, meaning our p-value is between $0.4* 2 = 0.8$ and $0.25*2$ = 0.5$  
Because the p-value is larger than $\alpha = 0.05$, we should fail to reject our null hypothesis $H_0$

Case 2: $\sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$
Ex2: Continue from last example, but $\sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$
- SOLN:  
Use the new formula for this case:  
$$T_0^* = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s_2^2/n_2}}$$  
We should also calculate the degree of freedom, rounding **down to the nearest integer**. Full example in video
$$v \approx 29.99 = 29$$  
We would then calculate our p-value with the new formula, similar to the old method, giving us:  
$$P(T_0^* \gt 0.231) + P(T_0^* \lt -0.231)$$  
Using table of t-distributions, with degree of freedom being 29, we get the value to be between 0 and 0.256  
This tells us that $P(T_0^* \gt 0.231)$ is between 1 and 0.4, and so our p-value is between 2 and 0.8  
Because our p-value is larger than $\alpha = 0.05$, we will fail to reject our null hypothesis $H_0$
