User Interface Intro/Tools (L2-5)
---

Usability and UI Design Goals
- Usability is more than just ease of use, can be divided into many potential goals:
    - **Learnability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish a basic task?
    - **Retention**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re-establish proficiency?
        - Also called **Memorability**
    - **Performance**: Once proficient, how quickly can a user perform tasks?
    - **Error Rates**: How many errors do users make, how severe are they, and how easily can users recover from these?
    - **Subjective Satisfaction**: How *pleasant* is the design to use?
    - **Accessibility**: How accessible is the interface to differently-abled users?
    - **Functionality**: What range of operations does the UI support?
        - Different than "the quality of being suited to serve a purpose well", specifically referring to *how much* it can do
    - **Trustability**: How much do users trust the interface (ie. getting users to put in their credit card info)?
- Difference from requirements?
    - **Functional requirements** are the required behaviors of a system, *what it can do*
    - **Non-functional requirements** are criteria to just the *operation* of a system (scalability, testability, maintainability, etc.)
        - UI design goals are closely related to non-functional requirements (aka **quality attributes**)
        - Functionality is tied to functional requirements though
        - Some specific goals may also be captured with tangible requirements sometimes
- **Trade-offs** are commonly made when sacrificing quality in one goal to improve quality for another goal, prioritizing different goals for different interfaces
    - Should not be expected to satisfy every usability goal to the maximum amount possible
    - Most UIs of enough sophistication need to make trade-offs
- Goals can also be measured
    - Will usually need to be done through users or comparing interfaces objectively
- There are other types of taxonomies for measuring usability (ie. effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction), but they all end up with the same ideas

UI Prototyping
- **UI Prototyping** is an iterative development technique in which sketches, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes are created
    - Users typically also in the process of creating and evaluating these
    - These methods are used interchangeably sometimes, main distinction being **low fidelity vs high fidelity**
- **Sketch**  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/sketch.png)
    - Hand-drawn representation of UI design, paper and pencil/back of napkin type design
    - **Virtually zero barrier to entry**
        - Even non-technical users can sketch
    - **Very low cost** to create
    - **Very low fidelity**
        - Low detail, less time to make but less valuable feedback
- **Wireframe**  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/wf.png)
    - Accurately represent interface page layout and organization of content, lacking details like color, typography, images, etc.
        - Can be done by hand but usually made in software for precision
        - Layouts can connect to one another to represent interactivity
    - More precision than sketches, but software is less accessible
    - **Higher cost** than sketches to make, more time consuming
    - **Higher fidelity** than sketches
- **Mockup**  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/mu.png)
    - Static but accurate representation of the application interface
        - Color, typography, etc. all included, interactivity can be hacked in, basically screen captures of the final interface
    - Made with purpose-built mockup tools or graphics editors (Photoshop, GIMP)
    - **Higher cost** than wireframes, more time consuming
    - **Very high fidelity** compared to wireframes
- **Prototype**  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/proto.png)
    - Accurate and interactive representation of the final project, only difference is no connection to back-end or related logic, may just use hardcoded data
    - Made with same tools as the completed app (HTML, JS, etc.), saves some development time
    - **Highest cost**, most time intensive to make
    - **Highest fidelity** prototyping tool
    - Allows for better verification and testing for the user, can also be used in sales and marketing
- Cost and fidelity rises when going from sketches to prototypes
- Generally, **sketches** are for discussing UI with a client, **wireframes** give a firmer blueprint to follow, **mockup** gives developers something to create and work towards, and **prototypes** are created by developers for final checks and working out issues before the full implementation

User Analysis
- Determining which characteristics of our users may influence the design of an interface
    - Closely related to, but distinct from **task analysis**, but often done together
    - Both user and task analysis are usually done before designing takes place, can vary significantly
- User diversity characteristics inclue:
    - Abilities (physical, cognitive, etc.)
    - Backgrounds
    - Socioeconomic
    - Motivations
    - etc.
- **Physical Abilities**
    - Physical abilities of user, including perception (hand size for making a phone, low/bright light for users, lond/quiet sounds)
- **Cognitive Abilities**
    - Short/long-term memory, problem solving, reasoning, language comprehension, learning, etc.
        - Most adults can hold **7 +/- 2 things in short-term memory**, so aim to have 5-9 menu items
- **Personalities**
    - Different ways to measure (Myers-Briggs is one), some interfaces allow modification based on personality (messy vs organized, etc.)
- **Cultural**
    - Beyond language translation, many other concerns when presenting information:
        - Titles (Mr, Ms, etc.)
        - Left-to-right vs right-to-left reading
        - Measurements, dates, etc.
        - Metaphors, etiquette, tone, formality
- **Differently-Abled Users**
    - Vision impairments (screen reading, braille displays), hearing impairments (captioning), motor impairments (speech control)
- **Age**
    - Seniors have reduced physical/cognitive abilities
    - Children have age-limited abilities like reading, comprehension
- **Gender**
    - No clear pattern of gender preferences, so a little inconclusive on most UI
- **Devices**
    - High speed vs low speed internet access
    - Display size and resolution
    - Input type (mouse/keyboard, touchscreen)

Universal Design
- Design of products/environments to be usable by *all* people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need of adaptation or specialized design
    - More of a design philosophy than a goal
- Should not always design for everyone, however
    - Would not be worth it if your app is only for a specific subset of users, but practice universal design when you can
- This is where user analysis becomes useful

User Research
- Focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methods 
    - Can be done before/during/after application production
- Does not require a working UI to perform
- Techniques:
    - **Interviews/Focus Groups**: High cost/time commitment per user, less anonymity (if any), but can be exploratory (get follow-up questions) and qualitative (see emotions in a user's face)
    - **Surveys**: Low cost/time commitment per user, quantitative (giving data for each question), can review questions for bias and other issues, more difficult to do with interviews
    - **Personas**: Creation of a representative user based on available data, user interviews. The person is fictional, but the data is not, helping to make a common reference point out of a lot of data and for devs to empathize with the common user
    - **Use Cases**
        - Descriptions on how users will perform tasks, including user's goals, steps, subtasks, how the UI can work, etc.
    - **Card Sorting**
        - Helps to arrange menus/workflows/navigation, answer what/how information should be associated with one another

Task Analysis
- Analysis of how user tasks are performed in order to influence the design of our interface
- The following characteristics are important to task analysis:
    - **User Domain Knowledge**: How much expertise does the user have that is relevant to the interface's problem domain (ie video editing problem domain: iMovie, Final Cut Pro, etc.)? Commonly broken down to beginners and experts
    - **User Roles**: What types of users are going to be using this UI? Same system can have groups of users with defined roles (user vs administrator, writer vs editor, etc.)
    - **Ethnographic Research**: Qualitative user research method based on observing users in their real-life environments (eg. observing workers in a factory, seeing different roles and what they involve)
    - **Tasks**: A goal-directed behavior or series of behaviors involving the UI. Often hierarchical, represented in a tree structure, with tasks breaking down into subtasks, into subsubtasks, etc.
        - Try not to refer to the interface, *especially* specifics, when making tasks (eg. click here, drag this). Should be used to inform UI design, not define it
        - Tasks not specifically functional requirements, since functional requirements could be disregarding any UI requirements
        - Subtasks can be ordered if one action needs to be done before the other
- Questions to look at for task analysis:
    - What makes the user begin a task?
    - How do users complete a task?
    - What information/tool does the user need to complete a task?
    - How do you know a task is completed?
- Limit subtasks to 4-8 per task, otherwise make more layers in the heirarchy
- **Hierarchical Task Analysis** is a form of task analysis, adding concepts of operations and plans to a task hierarchy. Operations are the actions performed by the user (still abstract), subtasks which cannot be broken down further. Plans are how tasks to be carried out (order, conditions)

Divergent and Convergent Thinking
- **Divergent Thinking** is a thought process/method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions (quantity of quality, novel ideas, create choices)
    - "Right brain", can involve brainstorming, thought journals, freewriting, mindset adjusting,SCAMPER, etc.
- **Convergent Thinking** is the thought process/method used to make a deliberate and conscious choice, purposefully applying criteria as we screen, select, evaluate, and refine options (essentially and analyze and filter step)
    - "Left brain", similar to analysis and judging
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/condiv.png) 
- Overall aids in **design thinking** and making **design decisions** for what solutions will be used


UI Design and Programming (L6-12)
---

Event-Driven Programming
- Foundational technologies:
    - HTML - Structure
    - CSS - Style
    - JS - Behavior
- Browser renders websites with HTML and CSS, and interprets and executes JS code
- The **Document Object Model (DOM)** can be manipulated with JS, allowing us to create/edit HTML elements themselves
    - DOM manipulation is key to making sites interactive
- Event-driven programming involves writing programs to deal with events happening in real time like keystrokes, mouse clicks/movement, etc.
- **Event Handlers** are functions written to handle events, while the **Event Loop** is a loop constantly checking for events occurring

UI Design
- **Design Decisions** are decisions made during the design of the interface, with many possible ways to make these decisions (intuition, experience, reference, consensus)
- **Guidelines** provide low-level advice about good practices and cautions against dangers, specific do's and don'ts
    - These tend to be specific to certain types of applications/devices/parts of UI
    - Can be good for direct help, but can also be criticized for being too specific, incomplete, hard to apply, and sometimes wrong when new data is found
    - Can be used as a part of usability testing
    - Examples in L7
- **Principles** are middle-level strategies/rules to analyze and compare design alternatives
    - Examples in L8, including **error message principles**
- **Theories** are high-level, widely applicable frameworks to draw on during design and evaluation, as well as to support communication and teaching
    - Full examples in L10
    - **Fitts' Law**: Predicts the time for as user to point to a target area, a function of the size of the target and the distance to the target (big buttons and corner of screen supports Fitts' Law, but corners of a window are hard to reach, making them least valuable)
    - **Norman's 7 Stages of Actions**: Stages users undergo while interacting with an interface, arranged in a cyclical pattern
    - **Four Principles of Good Design**: Principles of good design suggested by Norman's 7 Stages
    - **Gulf of Evaluation**: The degree to which the interface provides representations that can be directly perceived and interpreted in terms of the expectations and intentions of the user (showing seats in the venue for a concert would be a great/small gulf of evaluation, whereas just giving seat numbers would be a poor/large gulf of evaluation)
    - **Affordances**: The possible actions that are readily perceivable by a user (handle on a kettle lets the user know they can hold the kettle by the handle)
    - **Signifiers**: Tools that communicate where an action should take place, any mark/sound or perceivable indicator that communicate appropriate behavior (horizontal bar with a mark on one side signifies to slide, a water bottle lid with a lock/unlock symbol on it, signifying the button would lock/unlock the lid, 3D buttons in an interface)

Component-Based Front-End Architecture w/ React
- More interactivity means more DOM manipulation, which gets very expensive
    - Very complex DOM trees in modern apps, making many small DMO changes are not ideal
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** are a type of web app that only do one initial page load of HTML, CSS, and JS
    - Any subsequent data fetched using JS and some server with AJAX/WebSockets, page never refreshes in response to actions from user's view
    - Provides a superior user experience, no need for multiple pages but is more complex to build
- **Component-Based Frameworks** much more suited towards buildings SPAs
    - 3 main frameworks: Vue, Angular, React
- **React** is a front-end JS library for making interactive UIs
    - Uses a **virtual DOM**, a lightweight abstraction of a DOM, rendering onto existing DOM elements in the HTML
    - **Components** are used to be rendered to the DOM, using JSX code (looks and behaves like HTML, with few differences)
    - Commonly, one `App` component is made, and everything is listed under this component to have one clean `ReactDOM.Render` function, and divides other sections into their own components with their own render functions

Usability Testing, Planning, and Evaluation (L13-18)
---

Usability Testing
- Technique to evaluate the usability of an interface by testing it on users (users actually *use* the interface during usability testing)
- A form of **user research**
- Does not correspond 1-1 with verification/texting in development processes like waterfall/agile
- Helps to...
    - Identify usability issues
    - Learn if participants can successfully complete tasks and *how well* they can complete them
    - Find out how participants think/feel about the UI (subjective satisfaction, trustability, etc.)
- Can take place in many different settings at different points of development, but should have a..
    - **Test Plan**, documenting all details of how testing will occur
    - **Recruited Participants** to take place in the test
    - Findings will be **analyzed and reported**
- Types of usability tests:
    - **Sketch/Wireframes/Mockup (paper test)**: User asked to interact with sketches and non-interactive early-stage prototypes, shown to give better, more open feedback
    - **Discount Usability Testing**: Larger focus on qualitative observations, using earlier stage prototypes and think aloud method with only ~5 participants
    - **Competitive Usability Testing**: Compare one UI to another, with either one group testing A and the other testing B (*between-subjects*) or all participants testing both (*within-subjects*, most common)
    - **A/B Testing**: Two groups of users randomly assigned to a control group (no change) or a treatment group (with change), and a dependent measure is tested to see if there is a difference with groups
    - **Remote Usability Testing**: Done online, sometimes async, with the user, less ability to monitor user behavior but more cost effective than in-person testing, open to a larger population
    - Others
        - Field Testing
        - Universal Usability Testing
        - "Can-You-Break-This" Testing
        - Lab Testing
        - Guerilla Testing
- Observation techniques, tools, and metrics
    - Usability Metrics
        - **Metrics**: Things we measure during a usability test, associated with a number result and typically a unit
        - **Measures**: How we measure metrics, how we get/compare numbers (multiple ways to measure one metric)
        - **Logging**: When our application records metrics (like time) to perform tasks and error rates (high accuracy, can also be useful for remote usability testing)
    - **Note-Taking**: As the user performs tasks with the UI, take note to analyze and summarize later
    - **Surveys**: Can be done before/after the user uses the interface, using things like Likert Scales for measuring more abstract metrics. Pre-testing for collecting demographic data and user characteristics, post-testing to collect data about how users think/feel about UI. Anonymous and low-cost
    - **Interviews**: Can be done before testing, although always at the end. More expensive than surveys, but can be free form and can have follow-ups, allowing user to fully express feelings
    - **Think-Alouds**: *Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA)* when the tester asks the participant to think aloud while using the interface (less accurate for metrics like performance time but goal to understand stream of thought), *Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA)* when participant retraces their thoughts after using the interface (less reliable for understanding thoughts but doesn't interfere with usability metrics)
    - **Probing**: *Concurrent Probing* when the tester asks the participant probing questions about thoughts as they use the interface, *Retrospective Probing* when tester asks probing questions about thoughts after they use the interface
    - Others
        - Eye-Tracing
        - First-Click Testing
        - 5-Second Testing

Usability Test Plans
- Documents all aspects on *how* the test will occur, including all following aspects
- **Scope**: What application is being tested? What feature(s) of the application are being tested? What point of development/version of project is the testing occurring with?
- **Purpose**: What are you concerned with? What questions do you want answered, what are the goals (can be general/specific)?
- **Schedule/Location**: When/where will the test take place? Remotely or in person? How many sessions (be specific)?
- **Format**: Moderated or unmoderated? Synchronous or asynchronous?
- **Participants**: Who are the participants? How were/will they be recruited? How well do they match the target demographic?
- **Equipment**: What equipment will be used during the test (hardware and software)? What will be recorded, if anything?
- **Roles**: Who will conduct the usability tests and what role will they play?
- **Sessions**: What is the order of activities for a test session with a participant? How long will a session take?
- **Tasks/Scenarios**: What tasks are the user to carry out? Better written in the form of scenarios of specific info, called "task scenarios"
    - **Exploratory tasks** are open ended, may not have a specific/correct answer (data on how people think/navigate)
    - **Specific tasks** are more focussed and have a definitive end point (more useful, can gather quantitative and qualitative data)
- **Observations**: How will you measure observations? Will you be recording any metrics? Will you be using any instruments (surveys/interviews)?
- **Metrics**: What quantitative/qualitative metrics will you measure? How will you measure them
- **Instruments**: What instruments will be used? when will they be used? What are the questions? Scripted or unscripted?
- **Participant Instruction** (in case of async testing): Instructions on how to complete the test, like how to access the application or any surveys

Usability Test Report
- Can be a paper or verbally in a meeting
- Should include:
    - **Background Summary**: Scope, purpose, schedule/location
    - **Methodology**: Format, participants, equipment, etc. (all fields of planning)
    - **Test Results**: Present data collected, anything expected/unexpected findings
    - **Analysis of Results**: What was learned? What is evident/likely from the results (findings)? How does data support the findings?
    - **Recommendations**: Changes recommended as a result of the findings of the usability test

Usability Evaluation
- Encompasses anything that analyzes the UI, like usability testing and inspections
- Can also be done during active use through
    - Continuous user data logging helps to log and analyze user data, look for patterns and improve the UI
    - Forms/wikis/social media helps users to share opinions, can build off those
    - Beta testing helps identify bugs in software pre-release, usually a form of acceptance testing

Usability Inspections
- Evaluations of the UI through inspection, generally performed by non-users such as usability experts
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Evaluator (ideally usability expert) evaluates an interface with respect to a set of guidelines, also possibly principles/theories. Primary goal to identify usability issues and problems with the design of the interface. Can be done per-task or for the whole UI
    - Advantages: Fast/inexpensive, can be done early in development process w/o users using internal resources instead
    - Disadvantages: Results influenced by knowledge/bias of reviewer, only one reviewer means they may miss things
- **Cognitive Walkthrough**: Usability inspection method where evaluator(s) step through tasks the users will perform. Evaluator(s) simulate a user's thought process at each step in a task, goal to uncover usability issues, particularly w.r.t learnability. Only done on a per-task basis
    - Advantages: Similar to heuristic (cost/time, don't need users, can be done internally)
    - Disadvantages: Evaluators fumble around, confused with the interface in practice, judging the UI based on this confusion rather than the optimal path, can be very time consuming
- **Pluralistic Walkthrough**: Group of devs, usability experts, and representative users stepping through tasks and interface supports and discussing usability issues at each step. Done with hardcopy panels, either prototypes or screen displays. At each step until the task is complete, facilitator has participants share their thoughts and notes
    - Advantages: Developers gain appreciation for user frustration, re-design ideas incorporate thoughts of all stakeholders present, can produce good usability data early in development
    - Disadvantages: Very time consuming, difficult to schedule everyone at once, nature of optimal path walkthrough does not support browsing/navigation behaviors

User Help
- Documentation and user support facilities to help users understand how to use an interface
    - Sometimes called user assistance
- Documentation includes manuals, videos, guides, etc.
- User support includes chat help, forums, tech support, etc.

User Documentation
- Effective documentation can reduce requests for help from users, reduce need for expensive call centers
- Can be created based on information learned from usability evaluations
- **Manuals**: Documents that provide assistance to people using a software system, may be provided on a per-user type basis
    - Many do not like these though, learn better from demonstration than reading, also manuals are usually more in-depth than the user wants to go, user just wants to accomplish a task
- **Online Help**: On-screen instructions for using software, immediately available within the application or from a website, tends to be on a per-topic basis with searchable guides and documents
    - Not as bad as manuals but still not very well liked, a bit easier to use with searching and digital resources though
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Provide a guided walkthough/demonstration for how to complete a task, done one subtask at a time
    - Can be print (with images usually) or video format
- **Quick Start Guides**: Quickly familiarizes the user with the most important features of the interfaces, can include step-by-step instructions for these features
    - Tend to be popular, build confidence that the product is not hard to use, promotes exploration and further research into application features
- **Tutorials**: Similar to step-by-step guides in terms of teaching how to do something, more comprehensive and may cover a topic more thoroughly
    - May also be done in print or in video, can be internal or external from the application
- **Context-Sensitive Help**: Provided within the context of the current state of the software, things like tooltips on mouse hover, information on current options
    - Gives exactly what information is needed when it is needed, clippy would fall under this category
- Alternate support methods when documentation doesn't work
    - Phone/Chat Support: One-on-one "tech support" delivered instantly, usually just someone walking the user through a written guide
    - Forums: Allow users to ask questions and receive support from product staff and/or other users

(Geolocation lecture notes on L18)

User Interface Types (L19-21)
---

User Interface Types
- **Command-Line Interfaces**: Process commands represented as strings, read and run by a command-line interpreter (shell is an interpreter for an OS)
    - Advantages: Superior performance if the user has memorized commands to perform tasks, scripting commands more straightforward than GUI systems, less resources needed to run
    - Disadvantages: Slower performance if user does not know commands, terrible for learnability, high error rates due to need of exact strings
- **Graphical User Interfaces**: Allow users to interact with visual graphical elements such as windows, icons, and buttons, commonly using analogies to real-world stand-ins for computer elements (symbols, file/folder, trash, etc.), also uses direct manipulation
    - Advantages: High learnability, visually more appealing, allows for a number of input methods
    - Disadvantages: Requires more resources, performance can be slower for expert users
- **Direct Manipulation (Tool)**: An interaction style defined by the following:
    1. Continuous representations of object and actions of interest with meaningful visual metaphors
    2. Physical actions of presses of labelled interface objects instead of complex syntax
    3. Rapid, incremental, and reversible actions whose effects on objects are immediately visible
    - Advantages: Rapid learnability, errors avoided, users feel "in control"
    - Disadvantages: Accessibility may suffer, slower performance, learnability dependent on good visual metaphors being available for all actions
- **Motion-Tracking Interfaces**: Work by tracking movement of subjects (Kinect) and/or objects (Wii Remote), most often used in VR
    - Advantages: May be more intuitive than metaphors due to being natural movements, can be enjoyable for users
    - Disadvantages: Accessibility may be an issue, movement is restricted, actions limited by accuracy of model
- **Gesture Interfaces**: Motion tracking interfaces may incorporate gesture recognition (waving a hand to scroll horizontally), can be a subset of motion tracking interfaces, would also include things like mouse movement though (tap, hold, drag, etc)
    - Advantages: *Same as above MTI*
    - Disadvantages: Fatigue of user, accessibility, learnability to discover gestures, accuracy
- **Touch Interfaces**: Work based on sense, motion, and pressure of touch
    - Advantages: Learnability, separate input device not required
    - Disadvantages: Can become scratched/dirty and cause errors, slower performance
- **Natural Language Interfaces**: Interfaces that use linguistic concepts such as verbs/phrases for control, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) for language recognition
    - **Conversational Interfaces** emulate a conversation with another user
    - **Chat UIs** use text string messages as a medium of communication (chatbots)
    - **Voice UIs** use spoken interactions as a medium of communication
    - Advantages: Can be excellent for accessibility and, depending on design, learnability
    - Disadvantages: Requires clarification dialog to use, accuracy issues
- **Voice User Interface (VUI)**: Use speech for interaction and communication (speech recognition to translate speech into text)
    - Advantages: Hands-free *and* eye-free operation, performance improves in some cases (better than typing), learnability can be excellent
    - Disadvantages: Privacy, noise, discomfort of tech always listening, error rates, discoverability
    - Full design guide in L20
- Others
    - Crossing-based interfaces, brain-computer interfaces, etc.

User Experience (UX) and Game Elements (L22-25)
---

User Experience (UX)
- UX is broader than usability, UI, and HCI, includes aspects like sales and marketing
    - More focussed on user's attitude and emotions regarding products and services, *focussed on the user's journey to solve a problem"
- Vaguely defined, but mainly focusses on all touchpoints that comprise the overall experience for a user with your product/service

UX Design
- Involves designing products and services with a focus on user experience
- Design goals may include things like habit/addiction, engagement, and emotions
- Can be broken down into four essential quadrants:
    1. **Experience Strategy (ExS)**: About developing a holistic business strategy, including touchpoints and channels outside of UI but influence UX, get users excited about using product/service before they do
        - Involves setting a vision for customer experience, which may analyze customer segments, key partners, company value proposition, channels (platform, online/offline, etc.), and key resources (content, patents, user traffic, etc.)
    2. **Interaction Design (ID)**: Effectively UI design
    3. **Information Architecture (IA)**: Organization of information in meaningful/accessible ways, setting up hierarchies, matrices, filters, etc.
    4. **User Research (UR)**: Also known as UX research, roughly the same as user analysis, task analysis, etc., looking a bit more at emotions and feelings of users
- Content Strategy: Focuses on planning, creation, delivery, and governance of content
    - Very important to UX. Even if usability is great, if the right content is not there at the right time, UX will suffer greatly
- Content Lifecycle (Eric Scime)
    1. Audit and Analysis: Content stakeholder interviews, competitive/objective analysis, etc.
    2. Strategy: Determine topical ownership areas, taxonomy, process/workflow for content, sourcing, voice/brand definition
    3. Plan: Staffing recommendations, content management system customization, metadata planning, etc.
    4. Create: Writing content, asset production, governance model, search engine optimization, QA
    5. Maintain: Plan for periodic auditing, advise the client, determine targets for success measurements
- Content strategy best practices in L22

Gamification
- Use of game design elements in non-game contexts
    - Using a game for purposes besides entertainment is **not** gamification, would be called a **serious game** (ie. an educational game)
- Can be used to improve motivation, engagement, productivity, learning, knowledge retention, etc.
    - Many of these associated more with UX goals than UI goals
    - Key value is ability to modify behavior
- Can be and is used beyond software applications
- **Examples of elements in L23 notes**
- Need to design carefully and thoughtfully, make sure to design for your audience
    - Choose appropriate game design elements
    - Make gamification meaningful for the audience
    - Motivate based on psychological needs (control, feedback, etc.)
- Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivation
    - Extrinsic Motivation is when you engage in behavior for external rewards (grades, money, etc.)
    - Intrinsic Motivation is when you engage in behavior because you find it rewarding in its own sake (reading a book you find interesting)
    - Offering too many external rewards can actually *decrease* intrinsic motivation, need to find balance
- Meaningful Gamification
    - Aims to help users find meaningful connections with the underlying nongame activities, and use rewards only when truly necessary
    - Avoid scenario of when rewards stop, so does behavior, aim for longer lasting behavior changes

Video Games
- Part of the HCI, but distinct from other HCIs
    - Regular UIs are expected to be as unobtrusive and usable as possible, whereas with video games, the interface is the game itself
    - Regular UIs are ideally error free for the user, whereas with video games, the game tricks the user into making errors and face challenges as part of the game
    - Commonly centered on real-time computer graphic simulations, made using the rendering API of the game
- UI goals are distinct in video games, but many basic UI goals transfer over like visibility of system status (health, ammo, etc), error prevention (menu confirmations), consistency (similar buttons for similar actions across games)
- People like to **play** video games, which is a range of intrinsically motivated activities, done for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious/practical purpose
- Intrinsic Motivations/Psychological Needs
    - **Need for competency**: Progression through a game, learning new abilities, enhancing player characteristics
    - **Need for autonomy**: Games allow for consequence-free autonomy, can do whatever you want, engage in scenarios out of reach for the player in real life
    - **Need for relatedness**: Playing games with others or interacting and supporting NPCs and characters in games achieves this
    - Some risks with fulfilling psychological needs through video games, may be used as an escape and lead to **problematic gaming**
- Can be beneficial though, leading to potential improvement of cognitive skills, psychological wellness, and social benefits
- Games as art/recreation have similar effects to art/movies, with the intersection of games, players, and culture all studied under **game studies**
- Some design heuristics given in L24

Simulations
- **Computer Simulations** use step-by-step methods to explore behavior of a mathematical model, often being some sort of physical system
- **Interactive Computer Simulations** involve human interaction (sometimes called "human in the loop") to simulate real-life interactivity
    - Very closely related to video games, often used in education, healthcare, and machinery training
    - Great in areas where cost of mistakes are very high and/or training is expensive
- **Virtual Simulations** are the recreation of reality depicted on a computer screen that injects humans in a central role by exercising motor contorl skills, decision skills, or communication skills
    - Distinct from VR headsets, can be point-and-click but still "simulate reality"
    - I/O can include things like haptic technologies (touch), omnidirectional treadmills, motion capture suits, and high fidelity controls/instruments (realistic airplane cockpit controls)
- Design discussed in L25

Game Loops
- While the game running, the loop will
    - Process inputs (things like button presses, mouse movements, recognized async and processed at the next game loop)
    - Update game state (position/velocity of any object, changes in direction, collisions, any AI processing needed)
    - Render frames (typically done by a rendering API, 2D just being shapes and 3D involving complex polygons)
- Game state can become very complex, with rendering and collision
    - Can do a simple collision detection of checking if boundaries have/will intersect (bounding box collision detection), or discretely check the intersection of paths if objects are too fast (continuous collision detection)

Game Engines
- Many problems related to physics/rendering are common across video games, so engines have been built to package general solutions towards common problems to be build off of
    - Became cost effective to license game engines rather than work from scratch
- Two very popular ones are Unreal (AAA titles) and Unity (indie titles)
- Also makes game dev economically viable for smaller independent studios

UX/UI Design Process (L26-29)
---

UI Design Process
- Many types, similar to agile/waterfall/etc.
- Most modern UI design processes referred to as UX design processes or UI/UX design processes
    - May also be referred to as "interactive systems design processes" or "design processes/approaches"
- Many can apply whether it's a digital interface or something else entirely involving users
- **Design Thinking**: Prominent design thinking process used in UX/UI
    - Five steps:
    1. **Empathize** with the user
    - Strong emphasis on this step, understand them and their problems and needs
    - Go deeper to see what values they have, how they think/feel/communicate
    - Can use **empathy maps** to give a visualization of your current understanding, while also showing any gaps in knowledge
        - Can also use bodystorming, engaging with extreme users, etc.
    2. **Define** the user's needs/problems
    - Create a **problem statement** that captures the main problem being solved
        - Can have multiple, but commonly one to capture all deeply
    - A good problem statement is focussed on the user and their needs, leaves room for creativity, and provides direction to the main design goal
    - Also **point of view** statements, a specific type of problem statement with three parts (user, needs, because (captures insights uncovered during the empathy stage))
        - *Altogether, [user… (descriptive)] needs [need… (verb)] because [insight… (compelling)]*
    - Can also assist with the problem statement by asking **how might we (HMW)** questions, inspiring brainstorming by asking the right questions without solutions
    - **Affinity mapping** can also be used, saturating a space with post-it notes and grouping based on relatedness, helps to process abd synthesize empathy stage data
    - **5 Whys** also used, keep asking deeper "why" questions as a response to each "why" question
    3. **Ideate** the solution(s)
    - Use divergent thinking to generate many potential solutions to the problem
    - Use of **double diamond model** to avoid just large raw number od ideas, instead emphasize creativity and challenge assumptions
    4. **Prototype** the solution(s)
    - Create a prototype(s) of your solution, can range from sketches to full prototype, allow for user research to obtian feedback
    5. **Test** the solution(s)
    - Involves usability tests with real/representative users, broadly defined for many forms of testing to get feedback in order to improve the design
- These phases overlap and are not exactly linear, iteration is often used
- Other methods exist like human-centered design, user-centered design, use-centered design, and usage-centered design

User-Centered Design
- An approach and process in which the user's needs/wants/limitations/characteristics/goals are taken into account during each phase of the design process
- Can be split into 4 iterative phases:
    1. **Specify the context of use** (user/task analysis)
    2. **Specify requirements** (task hierarchy, traditional requirements)
    3. **Create design solutions** (prototyping, implementation)
    4. **Evaluate designs** (usability testing, heuristic evaluations, etc.)
- These four phases overlap with the five phases of design thinking, different not well defined though
    - Main thing is design thinking emphasizes empathy, problem definition, and ideation, while this is a more general creatiev problem solving process, more geared towards traditional engineering of an interface
    - Can use both at the same time
- Alternatives for this do exist
    - Human-Centered Design: Involves inspiration (learn about users), ideation (generate possible solutions), and implementation (implement and test solution(s)), like a merge of design thinking and user-centered design
    - Function-Centered Design: Focused on implementing function, common in early-on technologies to just make the thing do what it needs to do
    - Design by Default: Designer creates something haphazardly based on own intuition and preferences, may work if the designer is a representation of target users, but may not
    - Use-Centered Design: Focus on problem domain and related tasks/goals
    - Usage-Centered Design: Focus on usage patterns, use cases, and task analysis

Participatory Design
- An approach to design that involves users and potentially other stakeholders (managers, partners, etc.) in the design process
- Also called co-design, co-operative design
- Goes beyond interviewing/surveying, involves users in help to ideate and prototype solutions
    - Helps to get better user acceptance but going against a small set of users may alienate them
- Need to accommodate for what users you're using, whether or not they know what is best for them, account for any power dynamics

Lean Startup Methodology
- Aimed at rapidly discovering whether a business model is viable
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is “the version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”
- Three main phases:
    1. **Build** an MVP to test hypothesis
    2. **Measure** its effectiveness in the market
    3. **Learn** from the experiment, create new hypothesis
- Repeat these phases with better and better MVPs, low commitment and easy to pivot the idea to match needs
- Also essentially seen in **Lean UX**, which is a UX design belief, also with three stages:
    1. **Think**: Create hypothesis based on assumptions
    2. **Make**: Create prototypes (MVP) to test hypothesis
    3. **Check**: Check prototypes with users
    - This also involves participatory design with stakeholders

**NOTE**: Design processes generally are done *before* software development process, outputting a prototype
- A highly iterative process like agile plays nicely with the iterative design process

UI Design Patterns
- Reusable solutions that solve commonly occurring problems
- Can be categorized as related to input, navigation, social, etc.
    - Another tool for making design decisions
- Need to make sure you're using patterns to solve the right problems, using design patterns **does not** equate to having a good design
- **Breadcrumbs**: Linked labels showing the user their current location in the website's hierarchy. Should not be primary navigation tool but helpful to have
- **Lazy Registration**: Signing up to a web app is a significant barrier/commitment to the user, should try to make registration come when necessary or piece-by-piece when needed
- **Forgiving Format**: Allows users to ender data in different formats (city, postal code, etc.), useful when more than one valid input type for data
- **Progressive Disclosure**: When not all information is disclosed to the user at once, and the user can choose to dig deeper for more info (view all replies is an example of this)
- **Steps Left**: Shows the user the number of remaining steps they have left in a process, good for when process can be broken down into >2 reasonable steps, make sure length is not unreasonable
- **Password Strength Meters**: A visual representation with color and length according to a password's strength, helps users choose more secure passwords
- **Cards**: Container for a few short, related pieces of information, particularly useful when a flexible layout is required and/or when information is heterogeneous, lists would be better for homogeneous data and comparisons

Software Architecture Patterns
- Several patterns relevant for constructing UI like single page application, MVC
- Component-based architectures like React is also an example of this, a broader and less specific approach to constructing a software

Anti-Patterns
- Common response to recurring problems that is usually ineffective and possible counterproductive
    - Things that *seem* like a good idea, but are actually a bad idea (can be subjective)
- **Click Here**: Users given a link with text "Click Here", non-descriptive and only makes sense when using a mouse
- **Dark Patterns**: Deceptive interface design to trick users into doing things they would not do (downloads/subscriptions/sharing information)
- **Sneak into Basket**: When an extra item is added into a shopping cart without the user explicitly requesting it, forces the user to remove the item if they don't want it
- **Privacy Zuckering**: Tricked into revealing more information than you intended (not having a cancel button on ask to share information, "illusion of choice")
- **Confirm Shaming**: When users are shamed for not confirming an option, "guilting" users into compliance or hiding the "opt out" options
- **Disguised Ads**: Ads that look like content or navigation to trick users to click them ("Start Download" buttons)

Accessibility
- Accessible design in HCI is the design of interfaces such that they are usable by people with disability
    - Disability would be any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do a certain activity or interact with the world around them
- **Assistive Technologies**: Assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities or the elderly population (hearing aids)
- **Universal Design**: One approach to achieving accessible interfaces, designing products and environments to be usable by all people without need for adaptation or specialized design (includes non-accessibility concerns like age and language)
- **Special Accessible Interfaces**: Designing another specific interface for people with disabilities, would need to be maintained alongside the main interface, ideally avoid this
- Principles of design given at end of L29

Types of Disabilities
- **Visual Impairments**: Blindness, color blindness, long/short sightedness
    - Blindness may need specialized interfaces like braille or speech input/output
    - Color-blindness can use things alongside colors to communicate information, like textures/shapes
    - Long/short sightedness is commonly handled by glasses, out of UI domain
- **Hearing Impairments**: Partial or total inability to hear, tinnitus or perceptive deafness (distorted sounds)
    - Hearing aids are commonly used to help with this, but can also design with volume controls, text transcripts of audio content, and sign language interpretations of audio content
- **Speech Impairments**: Range from issues like accents to stuttering to complete muteness
    - Provide alternate forms of input and output for VUIs, but that is the main UI type to focus on for this
- **Motor Impairments**: Partial/total loss of function of a body part
    - Assistive technologies exist for this lie head wands, sip-and-puff switches, and vocal joysticks, but can design by adding search functionality (reduce need for navigation), minimize number of actions to perform tasks, support navigation with keyboard and use hot keys/toolbars to access tasks directly instead of mouse
- **Learning Disabilities**: Area of weakness or inefficiency in brain function that significantly hinders our ability to learn, affecting reading, writing, mathematical ability, memorization, and other cognitive abilities
    - Help the user understand what things are and how to use them, ensure processes don't rely on memory


HCI Research (L30-31)
---

HCI Research
- Peer-reviewed HCI research is done to improve our knowledge of HCI in general
    - Helps to give backing to what has been learned based on real-life studies/statistics
- Different types of HCI research exist, creating different forms of new knowledge:
    - **Empirical Research** reports findings based on systematically observed data, following proper methods to generate this data, which helps to generate previously unknown insights based on newly obtained data
        - Includes formal experiments, fields studies, usability tests, and others
    - **Artifacts** are new inventions, which could be anything from new software, prototypes, tools, technologies, or techniques
        - Often formally evaluated as part of reporting the research done, but reporting is more holistic than empirical research
    - **Methodological Research** develops new or improved methodologies for research or designing interfaces
        - Methods need to be validated and described well enough to be duplicated
    - **Theoretical Research** creates new models, frameworks, and principles, providing use with new "ways of thinking" about problems based on data and evidence
    - **Datasets** may be provided to the research community as a research contribution
    - **Survey Research** is work done that synthesizes and summarizes existing research work, identifying common findings and gaps in research where there may be new opportunities
    - **Opinions** are a form of research intended to persuade the reader regarding a position, evidence and data will be cited to support the position but this is more of an "op-ed" type piece
- Focus on conducting formal experiments, helping to find harder truth and provide evidence to support broader principle and theories
    - Similar to psych research in this sense

Experiment Design
- HCI research is highly dependent upon experiments conducted with human participants
- Signal to noise analogy is one way of understanding the goals of this experiment (need to design experiments which observe the signal and ignore the noise)
    - Signal is something we wish to measure, noise is everything that could interfere with the signal (input type, user sitting or standing, etc.)
- A **methodology** is a way in which an experiment is designed and executed
    - Necessary for experiments since an experiment without one is not reproducible and commonly can't separate signal from noise
- **Factorial Experiments** exposes participants to levels of factors (variables) and observe the results
    - Factor could be a type of interface, and levels could be interface A and interface B
- Modern research requires **ethical approval** by the governing body overseeing the research
    - Example of why this is needed is seen in the **Milgram Shock Experiment**
    - Ethics approval may involve experiment purpose, plans for recruitment, methodology (anonymity?), artifacts, testing instruments, and plans for obtaining informed consent from participants
- An **independent variable** is a circumstance or characteristic that is manipulated or systematically controlled to a change in human response while the user is interacting with a computer
    - This would be the factors in factorial experiment
    - Can have multiple, but beware **interaction effects** between variables, altering observation values due to a **two-way effect** between variables, it is time efficient though
- **Dependent variables** in HCI research are measured human behaviors like performance time, user preference, etc.
- **Control variables** are variables that could influence the experiment, but are not under investigation
    - Set to specific values unlikely to influence the experiment
- **Random variables** are variables that are allowed to vary randomly as part of the experiment, things we cant control (age of participants)
- **Internal validity** is the validity that the effects observed are due to the test conditions
- **External validity** is the ability to generalize results to other people/situations
- Decisions made in experiment design commonly trade-off between internal and external validity
    - Reducing noise improves internal validity at the cost of external validity
- **Confounding variables** are circumstances/conditions that change systematically with an independent variable
    - Things that need to change to measure the independent variable properly (display when testing VR controllers and game controllers)
    - If it can't be adjusted, may need to acknowledge the independent variable is broader than originally designed

Tasks
- Things that the participants should do with the interface
- Should be **representative** of real-world usage (improves external validity)
    - Comes at the cost of internal validity
- Should **discriminate** between test conditions, changing based on changing independent variables to give meaningful evidence


Participants
- For results to apply to a population, the sample needs to come from that population
- Ensuring randomly selecting participants is important, word of mouth is less random than randomly selecting undergrads
- Statistical tests can be applied to results to determine if they are **statistically significant**
- **Statistical Significance** refers to the claim that a result from data generated by testing or experimentation is not likely to occur randomly or by chance, but is instead likely to be attributed to a specific cause
    - Need a good number of participants for this, try to use similar numbers of participants for similar experiments

Questionnaires/Surveys
- Can collect data from users at any point during the experiment
    - Given before tasks collects demographic and prior experience information, while after tasks is generally data related to the task (Likert scales for quantitative data, open-ended questions for qualitative data)

Within-Subjects vs Between-Subjects
- **Within-subjects** experiment design occurs when every participant is tested on each level of a factor
    - Requires more time per participant, may need to compensate
    - Variance of pre-disposition will be the same for each test condition
- **Between-subjects** experiment design occurs when a separate group of participants is used for each level of a factor
    - Requires more participants, non-trivial cost to recruit and run sessions
    - Depends on randomly assigning participants to groups to balance group characteristics
- Sometimes a choice is not possible (right vs left handedness requires between-subjects)
- Within-subjects is more common, but they can be blended
- **Order effects** occur in within-subjects design when the order of the interfaces alters the performance of the participants
    - **Counterbalancing** orders test conditions to compensate for other effects (eg. swapping the order around for half the participants)
    - **Latin squares** are $n * n$ tables where each of *n* symbols occurs only once in each column and each row
        - Balancing these ensures each condition precedes and follows the other conditions an equal number of times (**requires an even number of conditions**, odd numbers would need to be a rectangle to use all $n!$ combinations)
- **Learning effects** can occur where a participant does better on subsequent test conditions than prior test conditions due to learning that occurs during the testing
- **Fatigue effects** can occur when the participant's performance worsens across test conditions due to fatigue

Group Effects
- **Asymmetric skill transfer** can occur when the learning effect for one order of testing is different than the other orders of testing (A before B improved a lot better than B before A)
- **Group effects** occur when the mean value for a dependent variable is different between groups, can occur due to asymmetric skill transfer
- **Longitudinal study** involves repeated observations over a prolonged period of time, used to track improvements in performance as practice is accumulated with the interface and test new techniques against conventional techniques to determine the cross-over point (if any) in performance, estimating if it is worthwhile to swap techniques

Conducting Experiment Sessions
- Experimenter needs to conduct test professionally, including understanding/following procedure, ensure participant concent, and make sure they don't bias results by indicating what they're testing for

Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- Can be used to determine if a result is statistically significant
    - Effectively allow us to say that a result was not likely due to chance, with some degree of confidence
- Very important we choose the variables, test, and confidence levels in advance
