Scheduling Algorithms
===

Recall
- A periodic task $T_i$ can be represented as a 4 tuple:  
$(\phi_i, P_i, e_i, D_i)$
- If using a 3 tuple, we can use:  
$(P_i, e_i, D_i) = (0, P_i, e_i, D_i)$
- If using a 2 tuple, we can use:  
$(P_i, e_i) = (0, P_i, e_i, P_i)$

Cyclic Executive (CV)
- Table-driven gives off-line static-schedule which specifies *exactly* when each job executes
    - Assumptions:
        - Parameters of jobs with hard deadlines known
        - Task scheduling is non-preemptive
    - Non-periodic work can be run during time slots not used by periodic tasks
    - Sophisticated algorithms can be used
- Consider the following 4 periodic tasks:  
T1 = (4; 1)  
T2 = (5; 1.8)
T3 = (20; 1)
T4 = (20; 2)
    - What is the total utilization? How can we construct a schedule for this process?

- Hyperperiod
    - The least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of all periodic tasks
    - The max number of arriving jobs in a hyperperiod is denoted as N, with  
    $N = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{H}{p_i}$  
    where $p_i$ is the period of task *i*
        - In the example above, the hyperperiod H is 20 for the four tasks, and N=11
- Frames
    - We want scheduling decisions to be made at random intervals rather than arbitrary times
    - We can do this by dividing a hyperperiod into frames
        - Timing is enforced only at frame boundaries
        - Each task must fix within a single frame
        - Frame size is *f*
        - Number of frames per hyperperoid is $F = H/f$
    - Frame sizes have some constraints though
        1. A job/instance must fit into a frame, so $f \geq \max_{1 \leq 1 \leq n} e_i for all tasks
            - We do this so non-preemptive tasks can finish executing within a single frame
        2. *H* must be evenly divided by *f*, so there are an integer number of frames in the hyperperiod
            - Done to keep the cyclic schedule table size small
        3. *f* should be sufficiently small, so that there should be a complete frame between the release and the deadline of every task
            - Done to schedule the task before the deadline is missing
            - This is also given by the equation:  
            $2f - gcd(P_i, f) \leq D_i$
    - Back to the first example, what value should *f* take?
        - C1: $f \geq 2$
        - C2: *f* can be 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, or 20
        - C3: Only 2 works

- Task Slices
    - What if frame size constraints conflict/cannot be met?
        - Example being T = (4,1),(5,2,7),(20,5)
        - C1: $f \geq 5$
        - C2: $f \leq 4$
    - Solution is to "slice" a task into smaller sub tasks, ex:  
    $T_3 = (20,5) := T_{31} = (20, 1), T_{32}=(20, 3), T_{33}=(20, 1)
    - Q: Why not split $T_3$ into $T_{31} = (20, 2), T_{32}=(20, 3)$
        - ANS: T1 with a period of 4 must be scheduled in each frame of size 4  
        T2 with a period of 5 must be scheduled in 4 out of 5 frames  
        This leaves only 1 frame with 3 units of time for T3, other frames have only 1 unit of time and cannot have a job w/ execution time of 2
- Q: Given the task set:  
$T_1 = (6;1), T_2= (10;2), T_3=(18;2)$
    1. Determine the size of the hyperperiod
    2. Find all suitable frame size(s)
    3. Using frame size 6, construct an off-line schedule for CE implementation

- Cycle Scheduling Decision Summary
    - Three decisions:
        1. Choose a frame size (consider the 3 constraints)
        2. If a suitable frame size was not found, break constraint 1 to select a smaller frame size to satisfy C2 and C3, and partition tasks into slices
        3. Place jobs/slices into frames
    - In general, these decisions are not independent
    - Try to partition a job into as few slices as necessary
