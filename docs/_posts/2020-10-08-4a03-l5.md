Whistleblowing
- What is a whistleblower?
    - People who believe an organization is engaged in unsafe, unethical, or illegal practices, and go public with their charge, having no success with trying to correct it through internal channels
    - Commonly an employee or someone in the system
    - Can also report a client though, not just employer
- Why is it important? When is it done? When is it necessary? How are they different than "troublemakers"?
- Lots of problems for whistleblowers, since companies don't like being called out and will usually fire the whistleblower, as well as other companies not wanting to hire this person, harassment, etc.
    - No government support on this, people wanted:
        - Guarantee of a review of all complaints
            - Easy, just implement a system for review
        - Ensure a job in the industry after blowing the whistle
            - Iffy, but doable with some middle jobs somewhere
        - Ensure the complainant is not discredited
            - Extremely difficult
        - Ensure the complainant does not suffer financially while making the claims
            - Also extremely difficult
- Lots of horrible cases later, whistleblower laws were put in place
    - Whistleblowers were made anonymous, but the thing is if you report these things to your job, and then they get a slap from an "anonymous source" on that, they're gonna pretty easily trace it back to you
    - Also these laws have been under fire because they say they don't defend enough

Micro/Macro Ethics
- Micro Ethics
    - That which is covered by code of ethics
    - General things usually covered by laws
- Macro Ethics
    - That which concerns the larger questions about such issues as the natures of design/economy/being professional
    - Grey area, usually uncovered by rules
- Scope of Micro
    - Honesty, integrity, fairness, loyalty, fidelity to public needs
