Continuous Random Variable Cont.
===

Ex1: Suppose *X* and *Y* are both continuous random variables, and the structure of their **joint pdf** is given as:  
$$f_{xy}(x, y) = c(x+y), 0 \lt x \lt y \lt 4$$
- a) What is the value of C?  
SOLN:  
We can calculate this through a double integral:  
$$\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} (\int_{-inf}^{\inf} f_{xy}(x, y) dx) dy = 1$$  
Can do this through a graph as well. Shown in lecture but not entirely sure how it works. Mainly used for finding lower and upper limits of variables for the integration by seeing how they interact with the line $x=y$:  
$$\int_0^4 (\int_0^y (cx + cy) dx) dy = 1$$  
$$\int_0^4 (\frac{cx^2}{2} + cy * x |_0^y) dy = 1$$  
$$\int_0^4 (\frac{cy^2}{2} + cy^2 - (\frac{c0^2}{2} + cy * 0)) dy = 1$$  
$$\int_0^4 (\frac{3cy^2}{2} ) dy = 1$$  
$$32c = 1$$  
$$c = \frac{1}{32}$$
- b) Find $P(X \lt 3, Y \lt 2)$  
SOLN:  
We can get the bounds from the graph again or just calculate them as $x \leq y, y \lt 2$:  
$$\int_0^2 (\int_0^y \frac{1}{32}(x+y) dx) dy$$  
$$= \int_0^2 (\frac{1}{32} * \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{1}{32}*y*x|_0^y) dy$$  
$$= \int_0^2 (\frac{y^2}{64} + \frac{y^2}{32}) dy$$  
$$=\int_0^2 \frac{3y^2}{64} dy$$  
$$= \frac{y^3}{64} |_0^2 = \frac{1}{8}$$

How would we split the above equation, getting the pdf of *X* or *Y* from the joint pdf?
- SOLN:  
$$f_{XY}(x, y) = \frac{1}{32} (x+y), 0 \lt x \lt y \lt 4$$  
$$f_X(x) = \int_{-\inf}^{\inf} f_{XY}(x, y) dy$$  
$$= \int_x^4 \frac{1}{32} (x+y) dy$$  
$$= \frac{1}{32} *x*y + \frac{1}{32} * \frac{y^2}{32} |_x^4$$  
$$= \frac{1}{32} x * 4 + \frac{4^2}{64} - (\frac{1}{32} x^2 + \frac{x^2}{64})$$  
$$= \frac{x}{8} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3x^2}{64}$$  
This can also be done for *y*:  
$$f_Y(y) = \int_{-\inf}^{\inf} f_{XY}(x, y) dx$$  
$$= \int_0^y \frac{1}{32} (x+y) dx$$  
$$= \frac{1}{32} \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{1}{32} y * x |_0^4$$
$$= \frac{3y^2}{64}$$
