NOTE: Lectures will not be recorded just because they're so massive

**Business Organization**
- Choosing an organization depends on everything from cost to start, ability to raise funds, taxes, ability to attract employees, etc.
- Sole Proprietorships
    - You own and run the company, easy to form and run but hard to manage liability, raising capital, personal time commitment, and the owner would need to absorb all losses
- Partnership
    - Two or more persons carrying on a business with a view to making a profit
    - Relationship is consensual and contractual, written agreements not needed to show a partner relationship exists though
        - A court looks for substance between partners for partnerships, if a contract does not exist
    - Good for sharing assets, profits, and any liabilities, but usually liability is limited to their investments
- Corporation
    - Legal entity with existence and life separate from their owners, therefore not personally liable for issues/problems
    - Two types
        - Private: Does not trade publicly, no more than 50 shareholders, and the public is not invited to share in its securities
        - Public: Publicly traded, can have more than 50 shareholders
    - Shareholders own the corporation,  can sell/transfer shares, and receive profits in the form of dividends
    - Board of directors are elected by the shareholders, governing the firm
    - Officers are top management that carry out the goals and policies of the board of directors
- Crown Corporations
    - Companies only the provincial/federal governments can set up (ie. Canada Post, VIA Rail)
- If you're a shareholder of a corporation, you can't be sued *directly*
    - Lawsuits would go through to the corporation, since they act as *a real person*
    - Now, if you commit fraud though, and you go to criminal court, that's directly on you
- Civil liability of corporations
    - A corporation may be liable in:
        - Tort
        - Contract
    - Liability in contract and tort, or **civil liability**, is different from criminal liability
    - Corporation may also be charged with an offence under the *Criminal Code of Canada*
    - Example being SNC-Lavalin Scandal

**Risk & Technology Assessment**
- Why is risk assessment important?
    - Most technologies have some element of risk
    - Public perception of risk can influence tech deployment
    - We should be considering ways of managing risk to
        - Prevent harm to people, environment
        - Avoid worst consequences of technology
        - Improve quality of life (QOL)
- Note a lot of risk assessment and protection is more reactive than proactive, very hard to predict what can go wrong with a system
- Acceptable Risk
    - Difficult to predict which technologies are negotiable and which are totally out of the question
    - Most literature focuses on individual aspects like
        - Risk communication
        - Negotiation and conflict resolution
        - Models of public participation
- More People Exposed to Hazards
    - Larger flight capacities, more people in cities or within commuting distance, large interdependencies, dangerous plant facilities closer to population
- Meaning of Risk
    - Focus on effect on humans, especially chance of causing death
- Two main elements of risk
    - Probability of some event
    - Degree of consequences of that event
- Four catagories of risk
    - Familiar high risks (driving, hang-gliding)
    - Risks of low probability and large consequence (dam failure, earthquake)
    - Very low probability, very large consequence (asteroid hitting earth)
    - Risk buried in a background of "natural occurrence"
        - Difficult to separate consequences due to technology from natural consequences
- Risk assessment
    - Informal risk assessment, done without calculation, passive
    - Formal risk assessment (experts)
        - identification of possible hazards
        - How could the hazard occur? Probability? Consequences?
        - Risk = probability x consequences
    - Simple..?
- Four main catagories of risk
    1. Familiar high risk: Probability relatively easy to determine, consequences subjective
    2. Risk of low probability and large consequence: Probabilities difficult to determine, consequences equally difficult
    3. Very low probability, very large consequence: Guesswork on probability, very severe consequences
    4. Risks buried in a background of "natural occurrence": Difficult to separate technology consequences from natural consequences
- "Dread Risk", risks based on uncontrollable activities and devastating outcomes
    - Associated with...
        - Lack of control over an activity
        - Fatal consequences if a mistake happens
        - High catastrophic potential
        - Inequitable distribution of risks and benefits
        - Belief that risks are increasing and not easily reducible
- Biased Interpretations
    - Problem of systematic biases and public opinion
    - Does every death have the same impact? Death from murder vs diabetes
- Are 50000 annual highway deaths really equivalent to a single nuclear catastophie?
    - "Highway vision", many deaths in COVID still happening but 9/11 held higher since more people, more sudden, more of an "enemy", racism fuel
- Managing risk: principle of "acceptable risk"
    - People should be protected from harmful effects of technology, but sometimes the risks are too costly to protect 100%
- Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)
    - Helps in risk assessment, assuming free choice and ignoring classes in society, working towards making sure cost does not outweigh benefit
- Risk assessment (RA) and CBA have some fallbacks though
    - Does not distinguish between active and passive risks
    - Risk assessors would prefer to exclude the public from decisions that affect their interests

Other
- How do I write a mission statement for a company I don't know?
    - Focus on social engineering, can look at health, pollution mitigation, transportation, look at some idea of inequities to tackle
