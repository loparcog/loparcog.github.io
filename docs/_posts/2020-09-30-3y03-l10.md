Continuous Random Variables & Distributions
===

Normal Random Variable
- A random variable is said to be a normal random variable by the following:  
$X ~ N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
    - The PDF is given as:
    $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{AAA}\sigma} e^{-\frac{x-\mu^2}{2\sigma^2}}$
    - Calculating the CDF from this is very complicated, so we avoid that for this case
- A **standard** normal random variable is given by the following:  
$Z ~ N(0, 1)$
    - The CDF for this ($\phi$) is given in a table, which can then be calculated for different values of *Z*

Ex1: Files are transferred from a server to a computer. The time it takes to transfer is normally distributed with mean 5.75Mb/s and standard deviation 0.35Mb/s
- a) Find the probability that the speed is 5.5Mb/s or less  
SOLN:  
Let *X* be the random variable to represent transfer time  
$X ~ N(5.75, (0.35)^2)$  
$P(X \leq 5.5) = P(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \leq \frac{5.5-\mu}{\sigma})$  
Let $Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} ~ N(0,1)$  
$P(X \leq 5.5) = P(Z \leq \frac{5.5-5.75}{0.35}) = P(Z \leq -0.71)$
This actually is equal to the CDF of a standard normal random variable, and can be calculated from the table (value @ -0.7 and -0.01, to add up to -0.71):  
$\phi(-0.71) = 0.238852$
- b) What is the transfer speed that a file transfer is faster than 90% of the time?  
SOLN:  
We're looking for the following:  
$P(X \geq x) = 0.9$  
Let $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} ~ N(0,1)$  
$P(X \geq x) = 0.9 = P(Z \geq \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}) = 0.9$  
$P(Z \geq \frac{x - 5.75}{0.35}) = 0.9$  
This is the same as calculating...  
$1 - P(Z \leq \frac{x - 5.75}{0.35}) = 0.9$  
This can then be calculated fro the table (look for value closest to 0.1 in table)  
The row value is -1.2 and the column is -0.08, giving us:  
$\frac{x - 5.75}{0.35} \approx -1.2 + -0.08$  
$ x \approx 5.302$
- c) Find a symmetric interval of speed such that 99% of the time, the transfer speed is in that interval  
SOLN:  
We are looking for the following:  
$P(? \leq X \leq ?) = 0.99$  
We can restructure this to just find one value:  
$P(L \leq X \leq R) = P(\mu - a \leq X \leq \mu + a)$  
    - This will be solved next lecture
