Scheduling Algorithms Continued
===
Network Flow Problem
- Given a graph of links, each with a fixed capacity, determine the maximum flow through the network
    - Efficient algorithms exist to get the max flow
- How to derive frame size and schedule meeting all constraints?
    - Reduce it to a network flow problem
    - Use constraints to compute all possible frame sizes
    - For each possible size, try to find a schedule using **network flow algorithm**
        - If max flow has the same value as total execution time of all instances:  
        A schedule is found and we're done
        - Otherwise:  
        A schedule is not found and we need to look at the next frame size
        - If no frame size works, system is not schedulable using cyclic executive
Flow Graph
- Denote all jobs in hyperperiod of F frames as $J_1, ..., J_n$
- Vertices:
    - *N* job vertices $J_1, J_2, ..., J_n$
    - *F* frame vertices $1, 2, ..., F$
- Edges:  
    - (Source, $J_i$) with capacity $C_i(e_i)$
        - Encodes jobs' compute requirements
    - ($J_i$, x) with capacity *f*, iff $J_i$ can be scheduled in frame x
        - Encodes periods and deadlines
    - (*f*, sink) with capacity *f*
        - Encodes limited computational capacity in each frame
- How to find a schedule with a flow graph?
    - Maximum attainable flow is $\sum_{i=1..N} C_i$
        - Total amount of computation in the hyperperiod
        - If a max flow is found with this amount then we have a schedule
- If a task is scheduled across multiple frames, we must slide it into subtasks
    - Potentially difficult, but if we don't allow the algorithm to split taks, the problem becomes NP-complete (?)
    - Analogy: Optimal bin packing becomes easy if we can split objects
Cyclic Executive Overview
- **Advantages**
    - Cyclic executives are very simple - you just need a table
        - Table makes the system very predicable, can validate and test with high confidence
    - No race condition/deadlock
    - Task dispatch is very efficient, just a function call
    - Lack of "scheduling anomalies"
- **Disadvantages**
    - Brittle, any change requires a new table to be computed
    - Number of frames (F) could be huge
        - Implies mode changes may have long latency
    - Release times of tasks must be fixed
    - Slicing tasks into smaller units is difficult and error prone
- **Overall**
    - CE is one of the major software architectures for embedded systems
    - Historically, CEs dominate safety-critical systems
    - Simplicity and predictability win
    - However, significant drawbacks (overhead, strong assumptions)
        - Finding a schedule may require significant offline computation

Lab 3 Info
===
Goals
- Learn how to build and run real time programs in C on myRIO
- Get familiar with C/C++
Prep
- Read user guide for myRIO
- Download the instruction and source code zip from avenue
- Read the instructions and watch the demo video
Parts
1. Hello World: Create a C proj, compile, and run on myRIO
2. Use Sample Project: Import the sample from avenue, compile and run
3. Create a real time task: Copy source code as template, compile and run
4. Create a task as a thread: Use the template project again and source code, compile and run
    - There are also questions in this lab, worth 20%
- **Message the TA (Yangdi Lu) on Teams this time to get your myRIO IP**
