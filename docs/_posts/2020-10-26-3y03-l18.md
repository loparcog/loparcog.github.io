Samples
===

Sample Data
- For random variables $X, Y, Z$, the **observations** (values of random variable) are given by $x, y, z$
- Sample Mean: If the *n* observations in a sample are denoted by $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, the sample mean is:  
$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}$$  
$$= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}} x_i}{n}$$
- Sample Variance and Standard Deviation: If $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ is the sample of *n* observations, the sample variance is:  
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$  
    - The sample standard deviation, s, is the positive square root of the sample variance
- Sample Range: If the *n* observations in a sample are denoted by $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, the sample range is:  
$$r = \max(x_i) - \min(x_i)$$
- For *n* observations, the degree of freedom is $n-1$. This is what we use to calculate our sample variance

R Tutorial (In Lecture)

Stem-and-Leaf Diagram
- Steps for construction:
    1. Divide each number $x_i$ into two parts: a stem, consisting of one or more of the leading digits, and a leaf, consisting of the remaining digits
    2. List the stem values in a vertical column
    3. Record the leaf for each observation beside its stem (can have different leaves for different datasets)
    4. Write the units for stems and leaves on the display
    - Example:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/3y03/sal.png)
- Can also construct this using R
    - Left are stems, right are leafs

Histogram (Equal Bin Widths)
- Steps for construction:
    1. Label the bin (class interval, cells, classes) boundaries on a horizontal scale
    2. Mark and label the vertical scale with the frequencies or the relative frequencies
    3. Above each bin, draw a rectangle where height is equal to the frequency (or relative frequency) corresponding to that bin  
    Rectangle height = bin frequency / bin width

Note
- For R assignment, may be worthwile to look into R Studio app
