Voice User Interfaces
===

Voice User Interfaces
- Use speech for interaction and communication
- **Speech recognition** is used to translate speech into text
    - Long and interesting history, but out of course
    - Originally thoight to need to understand all speech would be important, but now only uses parts
    - Old speech required "training" with each user
- Modern speech recognition reached parity with human translators in 2017
- Advantages
    - Hands free *and* eye free operation, and at a distance
        - May be operated while doing something else
        - Can listen to commands across a room, a form of "ambient computing"
    - Performance improvements in some cases
        - Stanford study shows dictation 3x faster than typing
    - Learnability can be excellent since speaking is intuitive
        - Does require good design though
- Disadvantages
    - Privace
        - Would you want to log into a bank with a VUI?
    - Noise (multiple users)
    - Discomfort
        - Some people just don't like something is listening to them
    - Error rates
        - In transcription it may be lower than humans, but still errors in technical words and slang
    - Discoverability
        - How can users discover commands and capabilities of the interface?

Designing VUIs
- In contrast to GUIs, best practices in terms of guidelines/principles/theories are not as well established, new ideas still emerging
    - But guidelines do exist!
    - Remember that VUI overlaps the concept of a conversational interface, but they are not the same!
        - Many successful VUIs are **not** conversational
- Biggest challenge is Discoverability
    - Possible to allieviate or overcome it
    - Design guideline suggested by Lyndon Cerejo may help: "Onboard the user and help them get started"
    - How do different VUIs "onboard the user"
        - Essentially means get the user started with the UI
    - Can be done with regular speech examples the user can use
    - Can do an introduction
    - One of the simplest and most effective ways is to provide "example utterances" for different functionalities
        - Helps to achieve different functionalities
        - Users will also get a sense of how to command their interface in general, how to form commands, verb subject formats, etc.
        - **Utterances** are spoken statements
            - Commonly used in VUIs to refer to spoken statements
        - Can also make default responses to "help", to give other samples to guide the user as they go
- Error prevention
    - We can prevent errors in a VUI by expecting and accomodating utterance variations
    - In other words, if we wanted to let the user launch applications, we might accept variations like "launch/run/execute/start Safari"
    - NLP-based VUI APIs also allow us to train the app to recognize **intents** based on a set of sample data for each intent
        - Each intent will have a response action
        - Intent is essentially a command, and the response is the action that occurs for it
        - Pretty much essential for conversational VUIs
    - We can create an intent "greeting" where the VUI would respond with "hello" with data like: hi, hello, hi there, greetings, morning!, etc.
    - Can roughly achieve this with VUI APIs that match commands defined by regular expressions
    - VUI should also offer informative feedback, even if the command is not understood
        - Let user know that they didn't understand it but it processed their text
        - Can also ask user to repeat
        - Don't treat an error like an error in the system, would take out involvement with conversation

Voice UI Principles
- Conversation design: Humans rarely have conversations with one turn, design beyond it
- Set user expectations: Don't ask a question if you won't be able to understand the answer
- Confirmations: Make sure that users feel understood, and let them know when they weren't
- Conversational markers: Let the user know where they are in the conversation
- Error handling (above)
- Don't blame the user
- Novice and expert user support: Adapt to the experience/expertise of the users
- Keep track of context: Make sure someone doesn't need to repeat themselves
- Help and other universal commands
- Latency: Use audible or visual cues to communicate unavoidable system delays
- Disambiguation: If a user gives ambiguous information, use contextual clues to make a smart guess or ask for clarity
- Accessibility: Design experiences for everyone, no matter what their abilities, making interactins time efficient, providing context, and prioritize personalization over personality

Basic Guidelines for Successful Voice Design
- Reincorporation is key: When the customer has given you data, reincorporate it to confirm recognition
- GUI parity is not the goal
- Bevity is the soul of VUIs
- Use questions to guide multiturn interactions
- Choose personality moments wisely
- Test drive your sample dialogs in audio form
- Consider earcons (audio icons), but use sparingly
    - Comprehensive list given in slides, notibly some for platform-specific VUIs
