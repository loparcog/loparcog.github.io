Geolocating and Geocoding
===

Geolocation
- HTML5 Geolocation API allows us to determine a user's location and use it in our application
    - Show stores closest to them, ads relevant to area, etc.
- Privacy concern though, so all applications that use it require user's permission before location information is available
- Information can be determined by the browser/device in a few ways
    - GPS (very accurate, within meters, but does not work too well indoors)
    - Triangulation of cell phone tower signals (works better indoors)
    - Wifi signals (works better indoors, even when cell service is not available, triangulated from wifi signals available to the device)
- When using Geolocation API, all this work is done for us
    - We do someimes care about *how* the user was geolocated, because for example, GPS is far more accurate than Wifi
- Uses latitude and longitude (latitude being horizontal above and below equator, longitude benig left and right of prime meridian)
- Example code for Geolocation API would look like:  
```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    showPositionCallbackFunc(position);
);
```
- `showPositionCallbackFunc` is a function that is called when the current position is fetched, given the position as `position.coors.latitude` and `position.coors.longitude`
- Possible for geolocation to fail, and a second callback function can be provided to handle this
- Further example code given in lecture

Geocoding
- Allows us to take mailing addresses and convert them into latitude/longitude locations
- Important because our users will give us mailing addresses, but we need co-ordinates
    - To show on Map APIs, calculating location within a given radius, etc
    - People don't know and don't give their lat/long
- Geocoding is pretty expensive!
    - Tables of data and other methods used to match addresses to co-ordinates
    - Don't do it manually, use some sort of API
- Bing Maps comes with a geocoding API
- Example code given in lecture

Note
- Additional help for A4 also given
    - Will need to install React Router, explained in "Single Page Applications with React" lecture
    - Further explaination in this lecture video
