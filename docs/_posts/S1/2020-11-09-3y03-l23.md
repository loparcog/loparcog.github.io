Population Continued
===

Confidence Interval
- Let $\theta$ be the population parameter. If we want to calculate the confidence interval of the data using points $L,R$, we would need to calculate
$$P(L \lt \theta \lt R)$$
    - We need to know the distribution of the population to calculate this though
- Other formula also given in slides
- Ex1: Find a 93% confidence interval (CI) of a population mean of a Normally distributed population with $\sigma = 5.7$ and a sample with $\bar{x} = 3, n=10$
    - SOLN:  
    We will need to use the formula in the slides to compute the left hand and right hand side of the barrier:  
    $$L = \bar{x} - z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, R = \bar{x} + z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$  
    That final section added/subtracted is known as the **margin of error** (ME).   
    Now we must find $z_{\alpha/2}$ such that $P(Z \leq z_{\alpha/2}) = 1 - \alpha/2$:  
    $$E(z_{\alpha/2}) = 1 - \alpha/2$$  
    Note, the percentage is calculated by $100(1-\alpha)%$, and since ours is 93%, we get:  
    $$0.93 = 1 - \alpha$$  
    $$\alpha = 0.07$$  
    We can then calculate the average:  
    $$1 - (0.07/2) = 0.965$$
    We can then get the value from the normal table closest to 0.965, which is 1.81:  
    $$z_{\alpha/2} = z_{0.035} = 1.81$$  
    $$L = \bar{x} - z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$  
    $$= 3 - 1.81 \frac{5.7}{\sqrt{10}} = -0.26$$  
    $$R = \bar{x} + ME = 3 + 3.26 = 6.26$$  
    **Therefore, the 93% CI is (-0.26, 6.26)**
- Ex2: How big a sample do we need in the previous setup to have a 93% CI with $ME \leq 0.3$?
    - SOLN:  
    Recall, $ME = z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$  
    As $\sigma$ goes up, as does the ME. We need a narrower CI, but we can't change *z* since it is dependent on the percentage of the CI, and we can't change $\sigma$, so we need to edit the sample size, *n*. Note that as *n* goes up, the ME goes down  
    $$ME \leq 0.3 \rightarrow z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq 0.3$$  
    $$E(z_{\alpha/2}) = 1 - \alpha /2 = 0.965$$  
    $$z_{\alpha / 2} = 1.81$$  
    $$1.81 \frac{5.7}{\sqrt{n}} \leq 0.3$$  
    $$1.8 * 5.7 \leq 0.3 * \sqrt{n}$$  
    $$34.39 \leq \sqrt{n}$$  
    $$n \approx \leq 110.191$$  
    Therefore *n* should at least be ~111
