User Help
===

User Help
- Documentation and user support facilities to help users understand how to use an interface
    - Somtimes called user assistance
- Documentation: Manuals, videos, guides, etc.
- User support: Chat help, forums, tech support, etc.
- Some people don't like the idea of user help
    - "If it's a good interface, it shouldn't need user help"
    - Sometimes though, user help is either outright necessary or improves the user experience
- "I'm a developer, I'll never need to create user-facing help/documentation"
    - At smaller companies, it may be up to you
    - Even in larger companies, could be tasked with this
        - May also need to help others on this even if you weren't part of the creation
- Even if we seldom or never create user help personally, learning about it is beneficial

User Documentation
- Effective user documentation can reduce requests for help from users
    - Call centers very expensive in terms of labour cost
- Can be created based on information learned from usability evaluations
    - If we have discovered user frustrations or usability issues, we can design our documentation based on them
- Types of user documentation:
    - Manuals
        - Comprehensive, traditional print manuals
    - Online help
        - Searchable information through software
        - Doesn't mean "through the internet" here
    - How-to or step-by-step instructions
        - Print/video format
    - Quick start guide
        - Print/video format
    - Other: tutorials, context-sensitive help
- Manuals
    - Documents that provide assistance to people using a software system
    - Might be provided on a per user type basis
    - Big problem: many users don't use them and don't like using them
        - Also frequently not helped by manuals
    - Whole series of literature of papers researching this issue
    - Why don't people read manuals?
        - Well studied issues with many reason, but mainly:
        - Users don't learn well by reading, rather demonstrations or doing
        - Tedious to read, often not written well for the users
        - Users just want to accomplish tasks, they don't want to learn everything the interface does
- Online help
    - On-screen instructions for using software that are immediately available within the application or from a website
        - Tends to be organized on a per-topic basis
        - Tends to be searchable
        - May include install guides, trouble-shooting, how-to-guies, FAQ, etc.
        - Can be created in standardized formats
        - In some sense, online help is a "digitized" manual
    - Isn't notoriously poorly received as manuals, but still not very highly liked
        - Searchability and navigatability help though
- NOTE: Well designed manuals and online help are effective in studies
    - People still don't like using them though
    - Users want help designed to quickly help with their specific task
    - Users want to get started as quickly as possible
    - Users want help that is designed for them
    - Users want help from communicating with other users
- Step-by-step Instructions
    - Provide a guided walkthrough/demonstration for how to complete a task, done one subtask at a time
        - Might be called "how-to guides" or something similar
        - Can be print (ideally w/ images) or video format
- Quick start guides
    - Quickly familiarizes the user with the most important features of the interface
        - May include familiarization in terms of pointing out "what does what"
        - It may include step-by-step instructions for the most important tasks for the target user
        - Can be in print or video format, created internally/externally
    - Quick start guides tend to be popular, build confidence in the user that "the product is not that hard to use"
        - Promotes exploration and further research of more advanced features later
    - Making a good quick start guide
        - Designer needs to ask and answer:
            - What are the most important concepts a user needs to know about the interface?
            - What are the most important tasks of the interface for the user to know?
            - What are the most commonly used tasks of the interface for the user?
            - How should the information be presented to the user?
            - How can this information be presented as briefly as possible without losing what's important?
        - Tangible design work that needs to be done is probably a big part of why quick start guides are effective
            - Manuals just throw a bunch of technical information at the user, while this is tailored to ease the load on the user as much as possible
- Tutorials
    - Similar to step-by-step guides in terms of teaching you how to do something
    - More comprehensive, may cover a "topic" more thoroughly
    - Again, can be done in-print or in-video, and again, may be created internally or externally
- Context-sensitive help
    - Provided within the context of the current state ofd the software
        - Includes things like tooltips that appear on mouse hover, but may require clicking a button or another action, or may appear by default
    - Advantage in helping users exactly where they need it, in the same context that they need the help
    - Context-sensitive help may be delivered by anthropomorphic "assistants"
        - C L I P P Y
- Sometimes none of these will help, need more hands on help
    - Phone/chat support
        - One-on-one "tech support" delivered individually
        - Often just identifying the issue and directing them through a written guide
    - Forums
        - Allows users to ask questions, receive support from product staff and/or other users

Creating Good Documentation
- Can follow a process
    1. User analysis - understanding our users
    2. Design and create the documentation
    3. Review - inspect the documentation to ensure best practices are followed
    4. Usability testing - test the documentation with users
    5. Edit and revise base on results of 3-4
- Best practices can change based on medium being used as well
    - Ex: Best practices for print documentation
        - Don't use unfamiliar vocab
        - Write short sentences and paragraphs
        - Use easy to read fonts
- Most important is design the documentation for your audience!
    - Everything from user analysis applies here (abilities, backgrounds, cultures, etc.)
