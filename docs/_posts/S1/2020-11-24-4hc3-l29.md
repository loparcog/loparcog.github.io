Accessibility
===

Accessibility
- Accessible design in HCI is the design of interfaces such that they are usable by people with disability
- What does it mean to have a disability
    - Any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or interact with the world around them
    - Definition of a disability is contentious (is someone disabled by their body, or by a world that does not accommodate them)
        - Keep this in mind, very important
    - Disability is a form of identity for many people
        - Ableism is discrimination in favor of people without disabilities
    - As we age and our cognitive abilities decline, to an extent many of us will have a disability at some point in our lives
- Assistive technologies
    - Assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities or the elderly population (ie. hearing aids)
    - Also includes technologies that enable users to access interfaces, such as screen readers
        - We can design our interfaces in support of them being accessed with these technologies
- Universal design
    - One approach to achieving accessible interfaces
    - The "design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design"
        - Universal design includes accessibility, but is also a broader concept, including non-disabilities like age and language
- Special accessible interfaces
    - Problem with designing a special alternative "accessible version" of an interface is that you now have two interfaces to maintain
        - Will need resources to keep both up to date
        - In general, avoid this, look to make one interface designed to be accessible

Types of Disabilities
- Visual impairments
    - Blindness, color blindness and long/short-sightedness are some visual impairments
        - Long/short usually handled by glasses though
    - Color blindness effects ~300 million people worldwide
        - Cannot tell differences between colors, or rarely cannot see colors
    - Designing for color-blind users
        - Use symbols/labels/textures to communicate information in addition to colors
            - Can also have unintended side effects for people without colorblindness (ie. black and white screens, printouts or 
            such)
        - Specific themes can be created to tailor for different kinds of color blindness
        - Use underlined links (distinguishes from text)
        - Don't use colors to guide users in text help (eg. "click on the red button")
        - Avoid certain color combinations
        - Use alt text with images
        - Use properly structured HTML to help screen readers (properly use header tags, paragraph tags, etc)
        - Use larger font sizes, clearly legible fonts, support magnification
        - If referring users to figures for information, describe the information in text too (avoid just "see figure 2.1")
        - Refreshable braille displays are possible as well, although that's hardware
        - Screen reader software can read characters and possibly images on screen and produce speech/braille output
- Hearing impairment
    - Partial or total inability to hear
    - Other impairments include:
        - Tinnitus: hearing with noise/ringing sound
        - Crackling tinnitus: tinnitus with crackling sound
        - Perceptive deafness: sounds are distorted
    - Hearing aids may be used to alleviate some of these
    - Designing for hearing impairments
        - Allow volume control
        - Provide text transcriptions of audio content
            - Speech recognition is now readily available through APIs and quite good
        - Sign language interpretations of audio content can be provided
            - Also through specialized APIs
- Speech impairments
    - Range from issues like stuttering to lacking ability to speak (mute)
    - Other impairments include:
        - Dysarthria: slurred, slowed speech due to muscle/nerve damage
        - Spasmodic dysphonia: vocal cord spasms causing hoarse/shaky speech
    - Need to consider things like accents as well
    - What about VUIs?
        - Provide alternative forms of input and output (text output, selection of options for inputs)
        - Ultimately, a VUI-only app is inherently a hard barrier to accessibility, need an associated GUI
- Motor impairments
    - Partial/total loss of function of a body part
    - Includes loss of limb or paralysis, but also includes things like cerebral palsy, ALS, arthritis
    - May prevent users from using conventional inputs such as keyboard, mouse, or touchscreens
    - Assistive technologies can help with motor impairments
        - Head wand: worn over head/jaw to manipulate interface
        - Sip-and-puff switch: operated by blowing into a mouthpiece
        - Vocal joystick: map vocal sounds to directions and movement
    - Designing for motor impairments
        - Add search functionality to your application 
            - Reduces need to navigate, supports speech recognition to navigate
        - Minimize number of actions to perform tasks
            - Can you allow users to skip ahead of groups of content rather than processing through individually?
        - Support navigation with keyboard for those who cannot use mouse
        - Support access keys to allow user to access tasks directly (toolbar keyboard shortcuts)
- Learning disabilities
    - Area of weakness or inefficiency in brain function that significantly hinders our ability to learn
    - Learning disabilities can effect a user's ability to read, write, memorize, conduct math, and other cognitive abilities
    - Designing for learning disabilities
        - Help users understand what things are and how to use them
            - Involves using things that are already familiar with the user so they don't need to learn new symbols/terms/design patterns
        - Ensure processes do not rely on memory
            - Avoid memory barriers for content use
    - Dyslexia
        - Learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding)
        - **Not** a vision or intelligence issue
        - 3-7% have it, but up to 20& exhibit symptoms
        - Designing for dyslexia
            - Avoid using high contrast levels, provide pastel backgrounds
            - Use fonts known better for those with dyslexia
            - Keep it to 45 characters or less in a line
            - Support text with icons
            - Use illustrations/charts where possible
            - Support auto-fill on inputs where possible

Principles of Ability-Based Design
1. Ability: Focus on what the user can do, not what they can't
2. Accountability: Respond to poor performance by changing systems, not users
3. Adaptation: Interfaces may be adaptable to shift for different user abilities
4. Transparency: Let users know that accessible options are available, and can be changed
5. Performance: Try to match system state to users' abilities (ie typing with one hand on iPhone makes the phone suggest if you would like to use speech to text instead)
6. Context: Anticipate use environment (in car, at home), and modify state to account for that (VUI, touchscreen)
7. Commodity: Better to design something that doesn't need expensive hardware to function, try to make accessibility without barriers
- Note that accessibility in designs is increasingly legally required!
