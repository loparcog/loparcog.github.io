Control Systems
===

Control Systems
- What is a control system?
    - Desired output, desired performance with specified input
    - Performance: transient response, steady state error
- Types of systems:
    - Open loop
    - Closed loop
    - Multi-loop
- Block Diagrams:

- Time Domain vs Frequency Domain
    - The input/output are in the time domain, why do we need the Laplace Transform and want to investigate the system behavior in the frequency domain?
    - Consider a very simple circuit system:  
    $$RC\frac{dv_o(t)}{dt} + v_o(t) = v_i(t)$$  
    $$v_i(t) = 1$$

Laplace Transform
- Transforms from the *time domain* to the *frequency domain*, turning differential equations into algebraic equations and convolution into multiplications
- Laplace Transform:  
$$F(s) = \int_0^{\inf} f(t) e^{-st} dt$$  
- Inverse Laplace Transform:  
$$f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi j} \int_{c - j \inf}^{c + j \inf} F(s) e^{st} ds$$
- Table of Laplace Transforms given in lecture slides
    - Will usually not need to compute yourself
- Ex: Consider the unit step function $u(t)$, with $1, t \geq 0$ and $0, t \lt 0$:  
    - $$U(s) = L(u(t)) = \int_0^{\inf} u(t) e^{-st} dt$$  
    $$= \int_0^{\inf} e^{-st} dt$$  
    $$= -\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} |_0^{\inf}$$  
    $$U(s) = 1/s$$
- Laplace Transform of Derivatives and Integrals
    - If $L[f(t)] = F(s)$, then:  
    $$L[f'(t)] = sF(s) - f(0)$$  
    $$L[\int_0^t f(t) dt] = \frac{F(s)}{s}$$  
    - For higher order derivatives:  
    $$L[f''(t)] = s^2F(s) -sf(0) - f'(0)$$
    - Convenient method to transform differential equations to algebraic equations

Frequency Response
- For a sinusoidal input, the output of a linear system is also a sinusoidal. However, the output will have a **different magnitude**, and be subject to a **phase shift**:

- Another form of system model in frequency
    - Replace *s* with *jw* in transfer function $G(s)$ to get $G(jw)$ (Refer to original circuit example)
    - $$G(jw) = \frac{1}{1 + jwRC}$$
    - So $| G(jw) | = |\frac{1}{1 + jwRC}| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (wRC)^2}}$  
    $$\angle G(jw) = tan^{-1} (-wRC)$$  
    (The above is the phase shift)
- Why is *s* substituted with *jw* in a transfer function?
    - Laplace transform:  
    $$G(s) = L(f(t)) = \int_0^{\inf} f(s) e^{-st} dt$$  
    - Fourier transform  
    $$H(s) = F(f(t)) = \int_0^{\inf} f(s) e^{-jwt} dt$$  
    - Only difference is the variable substitution, therefore:  
    $$H(s) = G(s)|_{s=jw} = G(jw)$$


Time Response
- Why is it important?
    - Temperature control - how long does it take to reach a new steady state
    - Want 200 deg, but it goes to 250 deg before settling down, is this acceptable?
    - Want cruise control at 100 km/h, but actual speed varies between 80-120 km/h
- Lets examine the parameters that control the time behavior of systems
- Consider first order systems:

- The output response of a system consists of:
    1. A natural (transient) response (containing e term)
    2. A forced (steady state) response (whole number term)

Poles and Zeros
- In pervious example:  
$$Y(s) = \frac{s+2}{s(s+5)}$$
- $s=0, s=-5$ are poles, and $s=-2$ is the zero of the transfer function
    1. A pole at the origin generates a step function at the output
    2. The pole at -5 generated the transient response $e^{-5t}$. The further to the left a pole is on the negative real axis, the faster the exponential transient response will decay to 0
    3. The zeros and poles determine the amplitude for both the forced and natural responses

Transfer Functions from Block Diagrams
- ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4aa4/csbd.png)
1. $G_1(s), G_2(s)$ in series: $G_1(s) * G_2(s)$
2. $G_1(s), G_2(s)$ in parallel: $G_1(s) + G_2(s)$
3. $G_1(s), G_2(s)$ in a feedback loop ($G_1(s)$ fed back through $G_2(s)$):  
$$\frac{G_1(s)}{1 + G_1(s) * G_2(s)}$$

Characteristic Equation of System
- The characteristic equation is setting the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function to 0
    - The characteristic equation of 3 above is given as:  
    $$1 + G_1(s) * G_2(s) = 0$$

NOTE
- PCP will **NOT** be covered in the final exam, just basic idea of it may be gone over
    - No mathematics since there can be multiple answers
