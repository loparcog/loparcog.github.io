User Experience
===

User Experience
- What is UX and UX design?
    - How is it different from usability and UI design
- What can we say with certainty?
    - User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products
    - UX is **broader** than usability and HCI, it even includes aspects like sales and marketing
    - UX is more focused on the user's attitude and emotions regarding products and services
- *"UX is focused on the user's journey to solve a problem"*
    - Sometimes UI is boxed in by people who work on UX, separating basic code and frontend to UI and design to UX, but in reality there's massive overlap
    - UX is "design with an awareness of all the touchpoints that comprise the overall experience with your product/service"
- Unfortunately beyond it being "broader than UI", not a solid agreed upon definition of UX, and boundaries of UX and UI
    - Lots of vague definitions for people doing UX work
    - Not gonna solve this issue, but try to understand where what we learned goes into UX, and what does UX offer that we haven't looked at yet

UX Design
- UX Design / Experience Design involve designing products and services with a focus on user experience
    - UI design is encompassed within UX design, but UX has features not typically in UI design
- UX design goals may include...
    - Habit/addiction
        - May attempt to design for habit-forming experiences
        - Necessarily involves a broader view than UI
    - Engagement
        - Emotional involvement and commitment
    - Emotions
        - Design for specific emotions (ie. a haunted house, make users afraid)
- Sometimes a nice medium between task difficulty and skill level, keep users growing, avoid stagnation, keep in the "flow" zone
- Can be broken down into four quadrants:
    1. Experience Strategy (ExS)
        - About developing a holistic business strategy
        - At a high level, involves setting guiding principle and a vision for customer experience, which may analyze
            - Customer segments
            - Key partners
            - Company value proposition
            - Channels (platforms, online/offline, etc)
            - Key resources (content, patents, users traffic, etc)
        - Includes "touchpoints" and channels that are outside of UI but influence UX
            - Eg. hosting an informational event to sell and inform users about your product, get them excited, or positioning users on how they're going to use the product before they get to use it
    2. Interaction Design (ID)
        - Effectively UI design as learned in this course
    3. Information Architecture (IA)
        - Organization of information in meaning/accessible ways
            - Hierarchically by order of importance, sequentially in a path for the user to follow, geographically by location, etc.
            - Can also be broken down further, matrix, chronological, alphabetically, by topic/audience type
    4. User Research (UR)
        - Also known as user experience research
        - Roughly speaking, same as user analysis, task analysis, etc.
            - May look more at emotions of users and feelings in this case
- Content Strategy
    - Focuses on planning, creation, delivery, and governance of content
    - Very important to UX
        - Usability can be great, but if the right content isn't there at the right time, UX will suffer immensely
    - Onvolves processes and best practices not unlike those used in UI design (user help, etc.)
- Content Lifecycle
    - Erin Scime's content lifecycle stages:
        1. Audit and Analysis: Content stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis, objective analysis fo content environment, etc.
        2. Strategy: Determine topical ownership areas, taxonomy, process/workflow for content productions, sourcing, voice/brand definition
        3. Plan: Staffing recommendations, content management system customization, metadata plan, etc.
        4. Create: Writing content, asset production, governance model, search engine optimization, QA
        5. Maintain: Plan for periodic auditing, advice the client, determine targets for success measures
- Content Strategy Best Practices
    - Be useful
    - Stay up-to-date and remain factual
    - Be accessible to all people
    - Be consistent
    - Be able to be found
    - Help define the requirements for the overall site
