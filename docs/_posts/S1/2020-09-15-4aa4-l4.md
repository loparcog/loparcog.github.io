Module Building
===

**Example: Build & Load Module**
- With basic module "hello.c" and a makefile...
- `make`: compiles hello.c and will output the kernel object hello.ko
- `insmod ./hello.ko`: Will try to load new module
    - Fails if using a user account, need root access
- Static Keyword in C
    - Static can be used for both variables and functions, defining the scope of the object
    - Values of these functions/objects are **preserved**, even if declared again, or called/altered from out of scope calls
    - Local (**private**) functions only seen/used by the file it was declared in
- System Calls
    - `printf()` and `System.out.println()` is actually processed the same, making a system call to the `write()` function, where control is passed to the kernel and output is produced
    - Can you make a *raw* system call?
        - Yes, but usually the functions in other languages are easier to use. Example:  
        `printf("Hello World.\n")`  
        vs  
        `write(1, "Hello World.\n", 13)`  
        - Also safer to use language functions as to not run things on system level directly, and let the compiler deal with that
- Makefile
    - Used to make source code files into runnable object files, essentially acting as instructions for the compiler
    - To bundle objects, you first need to build the source files individually, then merge the objects together
    - First rule declared in the makefile is the default rule, running `make` in the command line will run it
        - Specific actions can also be declared, ie. `make clean`
    - Targets are made as:  
    ```
    targetName: target file reqs
        function to run (usually gcc)
    ```
