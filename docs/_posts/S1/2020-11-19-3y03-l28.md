*p*-Values Continued
===

Ex1: Continuity of p-value of two-sides hypothesis test  
$$N(\mu, \sigma^2), \sigma=10, n=35, \bar{x} = 54$$  
$$H_0: \mu = 5-, H_1: \mu \neq 50$$  
Q: Should we regret or accept $H_0$ when...
- $\alpha = 0.1$?  
SOLN:  
p-value = $P((\bar{x} \geq 54 \text{ or } \bar{x} \leq 40) \text{ and } \mu = 50)$  
We know this from the last question, with an answer of 0.018  
This value is **always** the same, no mater the critical region  
We know that $\text{p value} \leq \alpha$, so we reject $H_0$
- $\alpha = 0.2$?  
SOLN:  
Same as above,  
We know that $\text{p value} \leq \alpha$, so we reject $H_0$
- Note, instead of calculating the critical region each time, you can do this p-value calculation to solve this problem much faster

Ex2: Given $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, but $\sigma$ is unknown. We do have more information on the sample though (s = sample standard deviation):  
$$n = 35, \bar{x} = 54, s = 15$$  
Our test is given as:  
$$H_0: \mu = 50, H_1: \mu \neq 50$$  
What should we do when $\alpha = 0.1$? $\alpha = 0.2$?  
- SOLN:  
We use Z-tests for this  
$$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma}$$  
but when $\sigma$ is unknown, we use:  
$$Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$  
Furthermore, $n = 35 \geq 30$, so *n* is large enough for this to represent a standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$  
Now we can calculate the p-value for this scenario:  
$$p = P((\bar{x} \geq 54 \text{ or } \bar{x} \leq 46) \text{ and } \mu = 50)$$  
$$= P(\bar{x} \geq 54 \cup \mu = 50) + P (\bar{x} \leq 46 \cup \mu = 50)$$  
$$= P(Z \geq \frac{54 - \mu}{s / sqrt{n}} \cup \mu = 50) + P (Z \leq \frac{46 - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \cup \mu = 50)$$  
We use the unioned average as our average value in the equation
Subbing in values, we get:  
$$P(Z \geq 1.578) + P(Z \leq -1.578)$$  
$$p =0.114106$$  
We can now look at the alpha values:  
$p \gt \alpha = 0.1$, so we fail to reject $H_0$  
$p \lt \alpha = 0.2$, so we reject $H_0$

Ex3: $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ population, sample with $\bar{x} = 54, s = 15, n = 28$, and test:  
$$H_0: \mu = 50, H_1: \mu \neq 50$$  
What should we do when $\alpha = 0.1$? $\alpha = 0.2$?  
- SOLN:  
$n = 28 \lt 30$, so *n* is not large enough to represent a standard normal distribution, so we will use a t-distribution:  
$$p = P((\bar{x} \geq 54 \text{ or } \bar{x} \leq 46) \text{ and } \mu = 50)$$  
$$= P(\bar{x} \geq 54 \cup \mu = 50) + P (\bar{x} \leq 46 \cup \mu = 50)$$  
$$= P(T \geq \frac{54 - \mu}{s / sqrt{n}} \cup \mu = 50) + P (T \leq \frac{46 - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \cup \mu = 50)$$  
$$P(T \geq 1.411) + P(T \leq -1.411)$$  
Now we do the same thing, but we use the *t* Distribution table, use described in lecture  
We get $P(\geq 1.411)$ is between 0.1 and 0.05  
By the symmetric property of our t-distribution, we then know $P(T \leq -1.411) = P(T \geq 1.411)$  
So, the p-value is between $2(0.1) = 0.2$ or $2(0.05) = 0.1$  
We can then see when $\alpha = 0.1 \lt p$, so we fail to reject $H_0$  
However, when $\alpha = 0.2 \gt p$, so we reject $H_0$
