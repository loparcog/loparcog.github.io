Poles and Root Locus
===

Final Value Theoriem
- If a system is stable and has a final constant value, then this theorem can be used to find the steady state value without solving the system's entire response:  
$$\lim_{t \rightarrow \inf} x(t) = \lim_{s \rightarrow 0} s X(s)$$
    - Whether a given function has a final value or not depends on the locations of the poles of its transfer function. If there are poles in the right hand side of the s-plane, or if there are pairs of complex conjugate poles on the imaginary axis, the final value does not exist

Root Locus
- In designing a controller, the requirements of the user must be considered, including:
    - Rise time
    - Settling time
    - Steady-state accuracy
- Designed as an analysis method that tells us how the roots change when a parameter varies
- Closed Loop System
    - Consider the following closed loop system:  
    AAA(img)
    - The transfer function (TF) of the closed loop system is:  
    $$\frac{KG(s)}{1 + KG(s)}$$  
    - Note the pole locations change as *K* is varied
        - As *K* is increased, the roots move closer to one another
        - After a certain point, imaginary parts of the roots become larger and larger while the real part stays the same
- Rules for sketching a root locus
    - **Number of branches** is equal to the number of closed-loop poles, which is equal to the number of finite open loop poles or the number of finite open loop zeros
    - **Symmetry**: The root locus is symmetrical about the real axis
    - **Starting/ending points**: The root locus begins at the finite and infinite poles of open loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$, and ends at the finite and infinite open loop zeros $G(s)H(S)$
    - *Behavior at infinity**: The root locus approaches straight lines as asymptotes as the locus approaches infinitey. Further, the equation of the asymptotes is given by the real axis intercept $\sigma_a$ and the angle $\theta_a$, as follows:  
    AAA (finish)
    - **Breakaway or break-in points**: The breakaway/break-in points are located at the roots of the following equation:  
    $$\frac{d(G(s)H(s))}{ds} = 0$$  
    The gain *K* is minimum for break-in points and maximum for breakaway points compared to the gains fo all other AAA(finish)
