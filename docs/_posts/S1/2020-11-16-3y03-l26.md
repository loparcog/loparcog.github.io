Statistical Hypothesis
===

Statistical Hypothesis
- A statement about the parameters of one or more populations
- We know the following values:  
$H_0$: Null hypothesis, equality, $\theta = \#$  
$H_1$: Alternative Hypothesis, inequality, $\neq, \gt, \lt \geq, \leq$
    - For $H_1$, $\neq$ is a two side hypothesis, and $\gt, \lt$ are one side
- We have a general strategy for hypothesis:
    1. Assume $H_0$
    2. Consider the data: is there something that is very unlikely/implausible given that $H_0$ is true?
    3. If YES, reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_1$
    4. If NO, accept $H_0$

Ex1: Population mean $\mu$
1. $H_0: \mu = 50$
2. $H_1: \mu \neq 50$
3. Test statistics: Sample mean $\bar{x}$ shouldn't be *too far* from our population mean $\mu$
4. Critical level $\alpha$: critical region (48, 52)
    - We will learn to make a critical level from a critical region later on
5. Compute the value of our test statistic $\bar{x}$
6. Compare $\bar{x}$ with critical region
    - If it is in critical region, accept $H_0$. If it is not, then reject $H_0$ and accept $H_1$

Ex2: Find the critical region for a sample with $n=35$ from a normally distributed population $N(\mu, \sigma^2), \sigma = 10$
$H_0: \mu = 50$
$H_1: \mu \neq 50$  
For a given critical level, $\alpha = 0.05$
- SOLN: 
$P(? \leq \bar{x} \leq ?) = 1 - \alpha$  
If $\alpha \uparrow$, $1 - \alpha \downarrow$, critical region will be wider, $\bar{x} \leq a$ or $\bar{x} \geq b$ also wider  
$$1 - \alpha = P(a \leq \bar{x} \leq b, \text{and } \mu=50)$$  
$$\alpha = P(\bar{x} \leq a \text{ and } \mu=50) + P (\bar{x} \geq b \text{ and } \mu=50)$$  
$$a = 50-d, b = 50+d$$  
We only need to focus on one side which represents $\alpha/2$:  
$$\alpha/2 = P(\bar{x} \leq 50 - d, \text{and } \mu=50)$$  
$$\text{Population } N(\mu, \sigma^2) \rightarrow \bar{x} ~ N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$$  
$$\alpha/2 = P(\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \leq \frac{50 - d - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}, \text{and } \mu=50))$$  
$$0.05/2 = P(Z \leq \frac{50 - d - \mu}{10/\sqrt{35}}, \text{and } \mu=50))$$  
$$-1.96 \approx \frac{50 - d - 50}{10/\sqrt{35}}$$  
$$d = 3.313$$  
We can now calculate a and b separately:  
$$a = 50 - d = 46.687$$  
$$b = 50 + d = 53.313$$  
For this population and sample, critical level $\alpha$, we have if $\bar{x} \lt 46.687$ or $\bar{x} \gt 53.313$, then we should reject $H_0$

Error Types
$$\alpha = P(\text{type I error}) = P(\text{reject } H_0 \text{ when } H_1 \text{ is true})$$  
- Also known as the "significance level"
- Can occur when too strict on testing
$$\beta = P(\text{type II error}) = P(\text{fail to reject } H_0 \text{ when } H_0 \text{ is false})$$
- $1- \beta$ is the "power of a test"
- Can occur when not strict enough

P-Value
- The smallest level of significance (type I error) that would lead to rejection of the null hypothesis $H_0$ with the given data
