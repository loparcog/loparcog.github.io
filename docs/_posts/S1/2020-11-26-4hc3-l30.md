HCI Research
===

HCI Research
- Peer-reviewed HCI research is done to improve our knowledge of HCI in general
- Many papers published in journals such as Computers in Human Behavior
- Helps to give backing to what we've learned based on real-life studies and statistics
- Different from research and development, which is focused on creating new products and services
    - Of course, there is overlap on this
    - Essentially it is building to learn vs learning to build
- There are different types of HCI research which create different forms of new knowledge
    - **Empirical research** reports findings based from systematically observed data
        - Idea is to generate previously unknown insights based on newly obtained data
        - Empirical research methods include formal experiments, field studies, and usability tests among others
        - Proper methods must be followed to generate evidence and insights that are trustworthy
    - **Artifacts** are new inventions, which could be anything from new software, prototypes, tools, technologies or techniques
        - eg. a new algorithm for predictive text input
        - Artifacts often formally evaluated as part of reporting the research done, though reporting is more holistic than in empirical research
    - **Methodological** research develops new or improved methodologies for research or designing interfaces
        - Methods need to be validated, usually through some experimentation
        - Methods need to be described well enough to be duplicated
    - **Theoretical** research creates new models, frameworks, and principles
        - Theories provide us with "ways of thinking" about problems, they are usually based on data and evidence
        - An example would be the paper *Gamification: Using game design in non-gaming contexts*, which provided a more rigorous definition of gamification
        - Value comes from its ability to predict and/or explain future situations, best for long term
    - **Dataset** may be provided to the research community as a research contribution
        - eg. a dataset for behavior of undergraduates students with Snapchat across a year of study
    - **Survey** research is work done that synthesizes and summarizes existing research work
        - Can identify common findings and gaps in the research where there may be new opportunities
    - **Opinions** are a form of research intended to persuade the reader regarding a position
        - Evidence and data will be cited to support the position
        - Opinions tend to be much more rigorous than say an "op-ed" in a newspaper
        - Attempts to persuade the user rather than inform
- We'll focus on conducting formal experiemtns
- Especially important within HCI research, similar to psych research in this sense
    - Allows us to discover harder truths, provide evidence to support broader principles and theories
    - Without empirical data, we're kind of left with hand-waving arguments in HCI
    - Some standard undergraduate HCI courses focus *almost exclusively* on designing and conducting experiments

Experiment Design
- HCI research is highly dependent upon experiments conducted with human participants
    - See the reading this week on experiment design, Chaper 5 of Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective (used for provided definitions and this discussion)
- Signal to noise analogy is one way of understanding the goals of these experiments
    - Need to design experiments to observe the signal and ignore the noise
    - The signal is something we wish to measure, while the noise is everything else that could interfere with the signal (for a touchscreen comparison, signal could be speed compared to a keyboard, noise could be if the user was sitting down or standing up)
- A **methodology** is a way in which an experiment is designed and executed
    - Results from an experiment without a methodology aren't very useful since they're not reproducible
    - Experiments w/o carefully designed methodologies cannot separate signal from noise
- **Factorial experiments** exposes participants to levels of factors and observe the results
    - Facors are variables, and levels are values
    - eg. A factor could be a type of interface, and the levels could be interface A and interface B
- Experiments involving human participants have a long history in psychology
    - HCI borrows mostly from this area
- Some of this history is unfortunately pretty dark
    - Experiments designed without regard for well-being of human participants
- **Milgram Shock Experiment**, having participants deliver increasing shocks to users who were in on the experiment, who they believed was another participant
    - Most participants delivered shocks when given orders from experimenters, explaining WW2 war crimes
- Modern research requires **ethics approval** from the governing body overseeing the research
    - eg. McMaster Research Ethics Board (MREB)
- If you want to conduct research with human participants, you need to have it approved by the MREB first
    - This applies to things that can even be perceived as research by those outside McMaster
    - To those outside McMaster, might as well be "McMaster research" that is being done otherwise
- Process can be lengthy and time consuming
    - But is very rigorous, and they do speed things up if your research is unlikely to cause any harm
- Ethics approval may involve the following:
    - Experiment purpose
    - Plans for recruitment
    - Methodology
        - Including what/how data will be collected and anonymized
    - Artifacts
    - Any testing instruments
    - Plans for obtaining informed consent from participants
        - Do participants know they can leave the experiment?
- An **independent variable** is a circumstance or characteristic that is manipulated or systematically controlled to a change in a human response while the user is interacting with a computer
    - The factors in a factorial experiment
    - Can have multiple independent variables, but doing this can have **interaction effects** between variables
        - Changing two things causes a **two-way effect** between two independent variables, harder to measure the main effect that each change has individually
        - Cost and time efficient tho
- **Dependent variables** in HCI research are measured human behaviors
    - Performance time to complete a task, which interface was preferred, etc.
    - Can collect by observation of user, data logging, instruments, etc.
- **Control variables** are variables that could influence the experiment, but are not under investigation
    - Set to specific values unlikely to influence the experiment and report these values
- **Random variables** are variables that are allowed to vary randomly as part of the experiment, things we can't control (eg. age of participants)
- **Internal validity** means the effects observes (ie the differences in means on a dependent variable) are due to the test conditions
- **External validity** is the ability to generalize results to other people and other situations
- Decisions we make as part of our experiment design often trade-off between internal and external validity
    - Reducing noise improves internal validity at the cost of external validity
- **Confounding variables** are circumstances or conditions that change systematically with an independent variable
    - If we want to compare a VR headset to a conventional display, but a VR headset uses a different input device than a conventional display, then the input device is a confounding variable
        - Can't isolate comparing VR headset to conventional display without also having the game controller varies at some time
    - If we can't adjust, we may need to acknowledge our independent variable is broader than headset vs display, and include the game controller

Tasks
- After we give participants the interface we'll ask them to do something with it (tasks)
- Should be **representative** of real-world usage
    - Improves external validity
- Will continue tomorrow
