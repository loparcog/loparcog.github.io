Further Hypothesis Testing
===

Ex1: A company aims for 90% of people to be satisfied with their customer service. In a 80 people sample, 65 say they are satisfied. Find a significance level $\alpha = 0.01$, is this claim correct?
- SOLN:  
The population follows a $Bin(n,p)$ distribution. The hypotheses are:  
$$H_0: p = 0.9, H_1: p \neq 0.9$$  
From this question, we also get $n = 80, \hat{p} = 65/80 = 0.8125$  
Putting $\hat{p}$ on a line with the $H_0$ value, we get $L = 0.8125, R = 0.9 + (0.9 - 0.8125) = 0.9875$  
We can now start working on the p-value:  
$$p-value = P((p \lt 0.8125 \text{ or } p \gt 0.9875) \text{ and } p=0.9)$$  
Recall...  
$$Z_0 = \frac{ x - np_0}{\sqrt{np_0(1-p_0)}}$$  
Dividing top and bottom by n:  
$$ = \frac{x/n - n p/n}{\sqrt{\frac{np(1-p)}{n^2}}}$$  
$$ = \frac{x/n - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}$$  
The version of the formula doesn't matter, just whatever you want to use.  
Back to the question:  
$$= P(\frac{p - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}} \lt \frac{0.8125 - 0.9}{\sqrt{0.9(1-0.9)/80}}) + P(\frac{p - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}} \gt \frac{0.9815 - 0.9}{\sqrt{0.9(1-0.9)/80}})$$  
$$ = P(Z \lt \frac{0.8125 - 0.9}{\sqrt{0.9(1-0.9)/80}}) + P(Z \gt \frac{0.9815 - 0.9}{\sqrt{0.9(1-0.9)/80}})$$    
$$ = P(Z \lt -2.6087) + P(Z \gt 2.6087)$$  
Now using the Z-value table, we get...  
$$ = 2(0.004527)$$  
$$ p-value = 0.009054$$  
Our p-value is smaller than our $\alpha$, therefore we should **reject** $H_0$

Ex2: Two machines produce steel rods whose diameter is normally distributed with unknown variance, but we know that $\sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \sigma^2$.  
Machine 1 has a sample of 15 rods with $\bar{x}_1 = 8.73$ and $s_1^2 = 0.35$.  
Machine 2 has a sample of 17 rods with $\bar{x}_2 = 8.68$ and $s_2^2 = 0.4$.  
Test the claim that the machine 1 a nd 2 produce rods with different mean diameters with $\alpha = 0.05$
