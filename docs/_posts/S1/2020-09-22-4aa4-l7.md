Event Driven Programming Cont
===

Race Conditions
- How to solve a race condition in a uniprocessor system?
    - Disable preemptions when scheduling processes (only the process itself can voluntarily relinquish the CPU)
    - Use semaphores as **atomic** operation

Priority
- Linux Priority Levels and Nice Values
    - Linux has static priority ranged from 0 to 139, where 0 to 99 are reserved for real time tasks, and 100 to 139 for users
    - The priority is represented as a nice value (niceness) from [-20, 19] mapping to priority level 100 to 139
        - The lower the NICE (or priority) value, the higher priority a process gets. By default the priority value is 0
    - `nice`: chance process priority on linux, Ex:  
    `nice -10 <pname>`: Set pname's priority to 10
        - Can be done for lower level priorities, but need sudo access to change higher level accesses
- Getting and setting process priority can also be done in C, with functions:  
```C
#include<sys/resources.h>

int getpriority(int which, id_t who);
int setpriority(int which, id_t who, int value);
```
- Alternatively, a nice call can be done in C code to alter the priority of the current process:  

    ```C
    int nice(int inc);
    // Increases the process priority by inc
    ```

    - Threads can also be declared with a given priority value
        - This can make processes running in parallel to run one at a time if one has a higher priority/lower nice number
        - By default, a parent function will *usually* go through first before the child
        - If you increase the nice number of the parent process, then the child process will go first since it will have higher priority
    - Some functions and imports are shown within lecture slides
- NOTE: Setting the scheduler priority number does not work without sudo access, but nice works fine to decrease process priority, but not increase (only increase by nice by using sudo)
    - Nice only goes from 100 to 139 though, setting value as [-20, 19], where 19 is the largest nice number

What is the output of the example code?
- Output would be:
```
1
3
5
```
- Process is as follows:
    - Parent sets SIGUSR1 to handler1
    - Child sets SIGUSR1 to handler2
    - Child sends SIGUSR1 to parent, running handler1
    - Parent runs handler1, setting counter to 1 and printint 1, sending child process SIGUSR1
    - Child runs handler2, since that is its SIGUSR1 command, then printing 3
    - Parent runs main, adding 4 to the counter, and printing 5
- NOTE: Setting the signal in a child process will use that function if the signal is sent to the process, not whatever the parent process is set to
