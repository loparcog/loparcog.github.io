UI Design & Error Principle Guidelines
===

**Principles**
- Middle-level strategies/rules to analyze and compare alternate designs
    - More abstract than guidelines, requires more interpretation, but less abstract than theories
- Tend to be more widely applicable and enduring, since less specific and can be applied across different programs and different versions since they're so abstract
    - Following examples from "8 Golden Rules of Interface Design", developed/popularized by Ben Scheinderman

- Ex1: Strive for consistency
    - Similar sequences for similar situations 
    - Use identical terminology across the application
    - Consistent fonts/colors/layouts
    - Limit number of exceptions to consistency, ensure they're comprehensible 
- Ex2: Seek universal usability
    - Account for users age, language, etc, account for beginner to expert
- Ex3: Offer informative feedback
    - Interface should provide feedback on user actions, should be inline with the frequency and importance of the action
- Ex4: Design dialogs to yield closure
    - After series of action, give a sense of closure with informative feedback, organize actions with a beginning, middle, and end
- Ex5: Prevent errors
    - Eliminate possibility of user to make an error, and if they do make an error, interface should provide clear/constructive instruction to fix it
- Ex6: Permit easy reversal of actions
    - Wherever possible, make actions reversible, allow users confidence to try things, allow reversal of both single actions and groups of actions
- Ex7: Keep users in control
    - Give a sense of control, ability to go through content, skip forward and back, etc
- Ex8: Reduce short-term memory load
    - Users shouldn't need to remember information from one page to another, don't exceed the 7 +/- 2 rule of short term memory, break lengthy forms and processes into subforms and processes
- Many other principles but these are the "standard examples"
    - Further example could be something like "ensure human control while increasing automation"
        - Get strengths of humans and strengths of machines and try to merge them together

**Error Messages**
- How to improve error messages?
    - Make errors explicit and clear that an error happened
    - Make errors visible, not hidden/hard to see
    - Don't change application state too much in response to an error
    - Place error message close to where the error has taken place
    - Text should target the user, not the programmer
        - An error code can accompany it though to help standardize the error
    - Don't blame the user
    - Tell the user how to fix it (if possible)
    - Use "warm" language
    - Use proper icons, ie only use a giant red X if something very serious is going to happen
    - Is the word error necessary?
        - Can the user think of it as something corrective rather than something that went wrong?
    - Use humour!
        - Eases user anxiety, but don't go too far since you still need to give good information
