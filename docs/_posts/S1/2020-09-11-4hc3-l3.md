User Interface Prototyping
===

- Sketches, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes are all representations of UI used in interface prototyping
    - Referred to as **prototyping methods**
- **User interface prototyping** is an iterative development technique in which sketches, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes are created
    - Users are typically also in the process of creating and evaluating these design artifacts
- What's the difference?
    - Most textbooks and industries use these interchangeably, but we'll try to work further to break it down
- **Sketch**  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/sketch.png)
    - Hand-drawn representations of UI design
        - Paper and pencil, "back of napkin"
    - **Virtually zero barrier to entry**
        - Even non-technical user can sketch
    - Cost in time to create sketches is **very low**
        - Don't need to be polished or anything
    - **Very low fidelity**
        - Low level of detail compared to working product, less time to produce but less valuable feedback
        - High fidelity would be for things with detail matching the final product, but more time consuming to produce, more valuable feedback
    - Can model interactivity with sketches and other low-fidelity prototyping methods
- **Wireframe**  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/wf.png)
    - Accurately represent interface page layout and organization of content
        - Lacks detail like color, typography, images, etc.
    - Can be done by hand but expected to be more precise than sketches, software is commonly used by this
    - Wireframe layouts can connect to one another to represent interactivity
        - Not a requirement for a wireframe though
    - Increased precision over sketches, but use of software is less accessible
    - **More time consuming, higher fidelity** than sketches
        - Interface should very closely resemble the wireframe, some details aside
        - More concrete representations of designs made as sketches
- **Mockup**
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/mu.png)
    - Static but accurate representations of the application interface
        - Color, typography, graphics all included
        - Interactivity still not required but can be hacked in
        - Equivalent to screen captures of the final interface
    - Made with some purpose-build mockup tools, or graphics editors (Photoshop, GIMP)
        - Again, software barrier to create these
        - Can also be done with HTML/CSS to already start creation of the final project, but then would be harder to make changes
    - **More time consuming, very high fidelity** compared to wireframes
- **Prototype**
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4hc3/proto.png)
    - A prototype is an accurate **and** interactive representation of the final application interface
        - Can perform actions in the prototype and the result should be the same in the full working application
        - Only difference is it is not connected to any back-end or related logic, may just use hardcoded data
    - **Most high fidelity, most time intensive to create**
        - Made with same tools as completed app (HTML, CSS, JS, etc)
        - Saves development time, final step to connect to back-end
    - Prototypes can be completed with purpose-built tools as well
    - UI will be fully functional, which allows
        - Verification of the UI with customer/user
        - Build a help guide using the prototype for final product
        - Use in sales and marketing purposes
- Again, lots of these names are used interchangeably
    - Main change is **low fidelity vs high fidelity** to make a distinction between them
- Some tools listed in lecture notes for all the above
- Wireframe mockup demo @ draw.io
- Key relationship through all of these is cost vs fidelity, rising amount of time to make and fidelity of the modelling technique
    - Commonly going through testing and development between each step
- Note, this order is not "the design" in every company, all places have different design processes, this is just a useful order
    - **Generally**, sketches are for discussing UI with clients, wireframes give a firmer blueprint to follow, mockups give devs something to create, and prototypes are created by devs for final checks and working out issues before full implementation
- What does this mean for a SE expert?
    - Majority of SE grads work in prototyping stage
    - Freelancer or startups may get you working in every stage though
    - Larger companies can hire you for more specialized roles
    - Traditional wireframe seems the most likely to be skipped
- We'll focus on...
    - Doing some wireframes and mockups, but mainly focus on prototypes
        - Want to know how the tools work, but we will most likely end up working and applying skills on a prototype
- **Course Project**
    - Milestones roughly in lecture notes, but no dates yet
    - Groups of 1-4
    - Target user for app **must** be undergraduate students
        - Will be who is testing the app
        - Needs to be something reasonable and readily understandable
    - Application needs to solve a real probelm
        - Can't make a first person shooter, but you could make an educational game
    - Browser-based app, using webdev taught in tutorials
    - Can pick a technology stack you like, but other students will need to run it
        - If you need complexity, host it somewhere
    - Document will help define the scope, but it shouldn't be too large
        - Process/design is the important part, nothing to wild in backend
