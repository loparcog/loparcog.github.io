Linear Regression & Office Hours
===

Linear Regression
- To graph a distribution, we would use:  
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$
- The calculation for the $\beta$ terms are extremely large and in the slides
- We can then follow these steps:
1. Draw a scatter graph with $(x_1,y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$
2. Find estimation $\beta_0, \beta_1$
