Statistics 3Y03
===

Prof: Pange Weijie / pangw6@mcmaster.ca
- Email only from McMaster ID, include 3Y03 in the title, will get a reply in 2 business days

Outline
- Required textbook: *Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers, 7th Edition by Montgomery and Runger, Wiley*
    - 6th Edition should also be okay
    - Homework not assigned from textbook, just going to be a learning resource
- Video resources will also be available to help go through and solve related problems
    - Youtube account can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrzRcInhaT080LBvnQUXvlw/playlists?view_as=subscriber).
- Also class notes from 2019 that can be viewed, will directly relate with what's being taught this term
- Focus on pre-learning, go through slides and information before lecture to learn tools and equations, and then lecture will go through problems and examples with these tools
- VPN may be required, can install it [here](https://uts.mcmaster.ca/services/computers-printers-and-software/virtual-private-networking-students/).
- Major topics will include:
    - Probability, random vars and probability distributions, joint probability, distributions, data description, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, analysis of variance
- Course has a lot of content, will be hard to keep caught up, especially with online teaching now. To help catch up:
    - Prof will provide an email per week to give information on next lectures, assignments to do, notes to review
    - **Don't leave everything till the end**, keep on top of work and readings
- MSAFs can be used in this course
    - MSAFing a midterm adds it to the final
    - MSAFing an assignment/lab distributes the weighting among your remaining assignments or labs

Grading
- Assignments > 20%
    - There will be 7 assignments, all online through ChildsMath
- Midterms > 30% (2 Midterms, 15% each)
- Exam > 50%
    - Exams and test are closed book, but you get a formula sheet, all questions will be multiple choice

# TODO
- Assignment 1 due @ Saturday September 12th, 11:59PM
- Any math equations can be written in LaTeX using dollar sign syntaxing, for example,
```
Display equation:
$$\int e^{-kx} \, dx = -\frac{1}{k} e^{-kx}$$
```
turns into

$$\int e^{-kx} \, dx = -\frac{1}{k} e^{-kx}$$
