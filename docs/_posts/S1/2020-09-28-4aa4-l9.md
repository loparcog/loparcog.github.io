Quiz
===

Quiz 2
- Mainly used to give an example on what the midterm will look like
    - Will go over quiz answers after taking it
- More of a "review lecture"

//

Q1: What's the output of the following code?
```C
#include <stdio.h>

#include <sys/types.h>

#include <unistd.h>

int main()

{

  printf("Hello world!\n");

  fork();

  printf("Hello world!\n");

  return 0;

}
```
- MY ANS:  
```
Hello world! 
Hello world! 
Hello world!
```
- ACTUAL ANS: **Same as my answer!**  
The `fork()` command only runs what is defined after it, making the main thread print 2 `Hello world!`'s, and the fork only prints 1, totaling to 3 statements

Q2: In unix the `_____` system call is used to send a signal
- MY ANS: `sigsend`
- ACTUAL ANS: `kill`  
It's a weird one but this is how signals are passed, and then immediately killed after running

Q3: What description about the following program is correct?
```C
int count=0;

static void charatatime(char * str)
{
    char * ptr;
    int c;
    for(ptr = str; c = *ptr++; )
    {
        count++;
        putc(c, stdout); //put a charactor c to standard output
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    pid_t pid;
    if( (pid = fork()) < 0)
    {
        perror("Fork error");
        exit(1);
    }
    else if( pid == 0)
    {
        charatatime("Output 1\n");
    }
    else
    {
        charatatime("Output 2\n");
    }
    printf(“Count = %d”,count);
    exit(0);
}
```
- MY ANS: There is a race, since the two outputs can end up arbitrarily interleaved.
- ACTUAL ANS: **Same as my answer!**  
Both fork and parent are set to print at the same time, no one process waits for the other

Q4: Design considerations for a real time operating system are different from those of a general purpose operating system. Which of the following is NOT a feature of real-time operation system?
- MY ANS: RTOS can be implemented on top of general purpose operating system.
- ACTUAL ANS: **RTOS is a time-sharing system, which gives the tasks with high priority more CPU time**  
RTOS is not a time sharing system, so whenever an event comes through, it is given the full power of the CPU

Q5: Which of the following function is used to initialize a kernel module?
- MY ANS: `insmod`
- ACTUAL ANS: `init_module`  
`insmod` is to run a module on the system, while `init_module` is the function in the module used to initialize it. Furthermore, `module_init` is for naming a function not already named "init_module" as the init function

Q6: What is the Output of the following program? Note that the SIGCHLD signal is sent to the parent of a child process when it exits, is interrupted, or resumes after being interrupted.
```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<signal.h>
#include<wait.h>
int val = 10;
void handler(int sig)
{
    val += 5;
}


int main()
{
    pid_t pid;
    signal(SIGCHLD, handler);
    if ((pid = fork()) == 0)
    {
        val -= 5;
        exit(0);
    }
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
    printf("val = %d\n", val);
    exit(0);
}
```
- MY ANS: `val = 15`
- ACTUAL ANS: **Same as my answer!**

Q7: Write a program to create 3 period tasks T1(5, 1), T2(3, 1), T3(6, 2) using threads. Each thread generates 10 instances of a task. When an job is created, the program prints which instance of which job is created.
- MY ANS: ???
- ACTUAL ANS: Will be explained in next lesson
