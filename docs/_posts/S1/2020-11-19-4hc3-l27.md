UX/UI Design Process: More Design Processes
===

User-Centered Design
- An approach and process in which the user's needs/wants/limitations/characteristics/goals are taken into account during each phase of the design process
- User-centered design is now prolific, at least in some part of design processes, if not in whole
- Some alternatives though
    - "Function-centered design": Designs focused on implementing functions
        - Informal term, not something generally do purposefully
        - Common in early-on technologies, as economically design efforts are spent on just making the thing do what it needs to do
    - Design by default
        - Designer creates something haphazardly based on own intuition and preferences
        - Not purposefully designed
        - May actually work if the design is also a user or representation of user, but may not
- Directly connects with all concepts previously mentioned in the course
- A process that can be split into 4 phases, which can be done iteratively
    1. **Specify the context of use** (user/task analysis)
    2. **Specify requirements** (task hierarchy, traditional requirements)
    3. **Create design solutions** (prototyping, implementation)
    4. **Evaluate designs** (usability testing, heuristic evaluations, etc.)
- Also conforms to a set of principles
    - Design based on an explicit understanding of users/tasks/environments
    - Users involved throughout design and implementation
    - etc.
- What's the difference?
    - The four phases overlap with the five phases of design thinking
    - The difference is not well defined, different opinions
    - Can say a few things definitavely though:
        - Design thinking emphasizes empathy, problem definition, ideation, and other approaches
            - Can be used as part of user-centered design too
        - Design thinking is a more general creative problem solving process, user-centered design is more geared towards traditional engineering of an interface (specifically on "specifying requirements")
    - Bottom-line: there is more in common than differences, and we can use **both** at the same time
- Human-Centered Design
    - Also discussed as both an approach and a process depending on the source
    - Argued by some to be the same as user-centered design, others argue this is more general
    - Conforms with the double-diamond diagram, overlaps as well with design thinking
    - The process involves inspiration (learn about users), ideation (generate possible solutions), and implementation (implement and test solution(s))
        - Basically just condensed down to three instead of four steps

Related Niche Design Approaches
- **Use-centered design**: Focus on problem domain and related tasks/goals
- **Usage-centered design**L Focus on usage patterns, use cases (lots of UML diagrams), and task analysis

Participatory Design
- An approach to design that involves users and potentially other stakeholders (managers, partners, etc.) in the design process
    - Users and others are "first class citizens" in the sense that they participate actively in the same ways as designers
- Sometimes participatory design is often called co-design, co-operative design
- Goes beyond interviewing/surveying users, involves users to help ideate and prototype solutions
    - This may be the largest factor in increased user acceptance of the design
- Participatory design will increase time commitment though
- Risk that unused designs and design suggestions from users/stakeholders may actually alienate users
- Can take the form of interviews and other data like user video journals
    - May also involve users in the design itself though (generate paper prototypes, sketch diagrams on whiteboards, etc.)
- Can all participants really be "first-class citizens"?
    - Lack of knowledge, power dynamics
    - People may not know exactly what is available to help them, or what is best for them
- Stakeholders also have interests, who to accommodate for?
- Participants may be from vulnerable populations
- Participants can also be from vulnerable populations, need to be done carefully to care for any differences

Lean Startup Methodology
- Aimed at rapidly discovering whether a business model is viable
- **Minimum viable product (MVP)** is "the version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort"
- Revolves around forming testable hypothesis based on assumptions
- Three phases:
    1. Build - an MVP to test hypothesis
    2. Measure - measure its effectiveness in the market
    3. Learn - learn from the experiment, create new hypothesis
- And we repeat these phases to build better and better MVPs, with chances to pivot the idea
- Borrows from the scientific method
- Opposite of big design upfront
    - Instead of doing an extensive business plan based on interviews and market research, using best practices and theories, you build and learn that way
    - Can be very cost-effective in this sense
- **Lean UX** is essentially this applied to UX design
    - Still three phases;
        1. Think - create hypothesis based on assumptions
        2. Make - create prototypes (MVP) to test hypothesis
        3. Check - check prototypes with users
    - Involves participatory design, letting stakeholders work together corroboratively
    - Should be willing to pivot if an idea/assumption doesn't work
    - Less "deliverables" and design upfront

Design and Software Development Processes Together
- Design processes generally done *before* software development process
    - Output of design process would be a prototype
    - Prototype cleaned and completed in software dev process
- A highly iterative process like agile software development plays nicely with iterative design process
