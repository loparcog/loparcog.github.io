User Interface Types
- So far we've mainly covered graphical user interfaces, operated by keyboard and mouse
    - Sometimes called "point and click" interfaces
    - Covered web app and mobile web app interfaces
- Human computer interfaces is a broader topic though
    - We've covered the most common, conventional interfaces, but this will go onto non-conventional
- **Command-Line Interfaces**
    - Process commands represented as strings
    - The *command-line interpreter* is the program that implements a command-line interface
        - A *shell* is a command-line interpreter for an OS
    - Command-line was standard before GUIs
        - Why are they still around?
    - Still utilized in situation where the user is an expert
        - Software development, SSH, etc
        - Full keyboard-centric actions, no need for a mouse
    - Short term learnability cost is worth it for longer term performance improvements
    - Advantages
        - Superior performance if the user has memorized commands to perform tasks
        - Scripting commands more straightforward than GUI systems
            - Can also pipe outputs from one command to another
        - Less computer resources to run a CLI
    - Disadvantages
        - Slower performance if the user has not memorized commands
            - Terrible for learnability
        - If commands typed even slightly inaccurately, they will not function
            - Error message likely unhelpful
- **Graphical User Interfaces**
    - Allow users to interact with visual graphical elements such as windows, icons, and buttons
        - Windows and OS X are GUIs
    - Many GUIs leverage analogies to the real world (symbols, file/folder, drag/drop, trash, etc.)
        - More intuitive, easier for learnability
    - Uses **direct manipulation** (described below)
    - Advantages
        - High learnability, key for beginners/non-technical users
        - Visaully more appealing (subjective satisfaction)
        - Allows for input from mice and other devices
    - Disadvantages
        - Requires more resources
        - Performance can be slower for expert users
- **Direct Manipulation (Tool)**
    - An interaction style defined by:
        1. Continuous representations of objects and actions of interest with meaningful visual metaphors
        2. Physical actions of presses of labeled interface objects (ie. buttons) instead of complex syntax
        3. Rapid, incremental, reversible actions whos effects on objects of interest are visible immediately
    - Relates back to 4 Normal Design Principles
    - Metaphor feature of direct manipulation is key to what makes many GUIs feel 'intuitive to use'
        - "Feels like driving a car"
    - Popularized by Ben Schneiderman in early 1980s, in response to the desktop metaphor that modern desktop OS' use
    - But direct manipulation is broader than desktop metaphors, or even GUIs
    - Advantages
        - Rapid learnability
        - Errors avoided, error messages rarely needed due to rapid reversal of actions
        - Users experience less anxiety
            - Easy understanding and action reversal encourages exploration
        - Users feel in control
    - Disadvantages
        - Accessibility may suffer
            - Visually impaired?
        - If we need to represent objects to act on them, won't that limit the number of objects we can act on at one time?
        - Performance is slower, repetitive actions generally not well supported
        - Without a good metaphor, rapid learnability may not occur in practice
- **Motion-Tracking Interfaces**
    - Work by tracking movement of subjects (ie. Kinect) and/or objects (ie. Wii Remote)
    - Most often used in VR
    - Advantages
        - May be mroe intuitive than metaphors, interface can be natural actual movement
            - So natural it begins to reflect on reality itself, opens up training possibilities for real-life tasks (ie. surgery or other high-risk situations)
            - Can help save on training costs
        - Movement can be enjoyable for users
    - Disadvantages
        - Accessbility may be an issue
        - Movement is restricted (room size, user ability)
        - Is accuracy high enough to simulate real situations?
- **Gesture Interfaces**
    - Motion tracking interfaces may incorporate gesture recognition (ie. waving a hand to scroll horizontally)
    - Overlaps motion tracking interfaces
    - Gestures are visibile body actions that communicate messages non-vocally
        - Swinging, waving, swiping, pinching, flicking, etc.
        - Pinch-to-zoom is an example
    - Interfaces based on gesture recognition
        - Sometimes just a small part of the whole interface (ie. Wii Bowling recognizing the bowling gesture)
    - A mouse can be a form of gesture interface!
        - Tap, hold, drag, are all bodily actions that communicate a message
    - Specific gestures can be performed with a mouse to communicate a message
    - Smartphone and tablet *multi-touch screens* capable of recognizing multiple screen touches are popular gesture interfaces
        - Touch interfaces also a different category of interface though
    - Like motion tracking, useful for intuitiveness and enjoyment
    - In case of mobile touch screens, helps to remove buttons on the device to increase screen size
    - Disadvantages
        - Fatigue: getures take energy, can cause repetitive strain injuries
        - Accessibility
        - Learnability: how to discover gestures?
        - Accuracy: similar to motion tracking issues
- **Touch Interfaces**
    - Work based on sense of touch
        - Generally work by a user touching a touch-sensitive screen
    - Do not need to recognize multiple touches, many do not
        - ie. payment kiosks
        - Early touch screens were *terrible*, gotten better over time
    - Accessibility
        - Refreshable braille display is an example of a touch screen
        - Cited as a concern with different interface types
    - Advantages
        - Learnability
        - Separate input devices not required, cannot be lost/stolen
    - Disadvantages
        - Can become scratched/dirty, start to cause errors
        - Slower performance (ie. typing)
- **Natural Language Interface**
    - Interfaces that use linguistic concepts such as verbs/phrases for control
        - Accomplished using **natural language processing (NLP)** that involved language recognition
        - NLP is an active area of research
    - **Coversational Interface** emulates a conversation with another human
        - A form of NLI
        - Often take the form of an assistant (clippy, siri, etc.)
        - Some can be identified as **intelligent user interfaces** due to their use of AI
    - Can be via chat or voice
        - **Chat user interfaces** use text string messages as a medium of communication (chatbots)
        - **Voice user interfaces** uses spoken interactions as a medium of communication
            - Different since main action is translating speech into text
            - Siri/Cortana examples of speech VUIs
    - Chat interfaces and VUIs are often conversational interfaces, but don't need to be conversational
        - They can have "command-like" instructions (ie. "directions to McMaster University")
    - "Command-like" because the commands may not be as accurate or precise as in a command-line interface
    - Advantages
        - Can be excellent for accessibility
        - Learnability can also be excelent, depending on design
    - Disadvantages
        - Requires clarification dialog
        - Accuracy issues
- There are other types
    - Crossing-based interfaces, brain-computer interfaces, etc
