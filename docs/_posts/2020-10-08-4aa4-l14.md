Midterm Review
===

Concepts
- Classification of real-time systems
- Usefulness function of hard, firm, and soft real-time systems
- Differences between general purpose OS and RTOS (objectives, with Linux RT extensions, is RTOS necessary?)
- User space vs Kernel space (how to access kernel space from user space)
- Kernel module (advantages, structure to develop modules)
- Processes and Threads (pros and cons, how the address space is allocated, which segment of memory space is shared for multi-process and multi-thread programming?)
    - Be able to read C code, predict output
- Race Condition (when does it occur? Why is it bad?)
- Poll vs Interrupt (pros and cons)
- Scheduling Policies in Linux
- Parameters of real time tasks (P, d (relative deadline), D (absolute deadline), phase, waiting time, execution time, response time, etc.)
- Representation of periodic tasks
- Cyclic Executive Scheduler (why we introduced the frame concept, what is the length of the table driven in the CE scheduler, hyperperiod, frame size, scheduler designer)
- RM Scheduler (AAA)

Questions
1. What if $p_i \ne D_i$?
    - SOLN:  
    We replace $p_i$ with $\min(D_i; p_i)$ in the above expression
2. Determine if the following set of tasks is RM schedulable:  
(50, 10), (80, 20), (110, 40), (190, 50)
    - SOLN:  
    Recall the following equations:  
    AAA (finish equations)
    Using Test 3: (5, 1), (8, 2), (11, 4), (19, 5)  
    When $i=1$,  
    $$t=1 \Rightarrow \omega_1(t) = 1 \lt 5$$  
    (OK)
    When $i=2, k_1=1$ for task 1, $k_2=1$ for task 2, so:  
    $$t=5, 8 \Rightarrow \omega_2(5) = e_1 + e_2 = 3 \lt 5$$  
    (OK) (You can stop here for the $i=2$ case)  
    $$\omega_2(8)=2e_1 + e_2 = 4 \lt 8$$ (OK)  
    When $i=3$, possible $k_1 = 1, 2; k_2 = 1; k_3 = 1$, so possible *t* values are:  
    $$t=5, 10, 8, 11$$  
    $$\omega_3(5) = e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = 7 \gt 5$$  (NOT OK)
    $$\omega_3(8) = 2e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = 8 = t$$  
    (OK) (You can stop here for the $i=3$ case)  
    $$\omega_3(10) = 2e_1 + 2e_2 + e_3 = t$$ (OK)  
    $$\omega_3(11) = 3e_1 + 2e_2 + e_3 = t$$ (OK)  
    When $i=4$, possible $k_1=1,2,3; k_2=1,2; k_3=1; k_4 = 1$, so possible *t* values are:  
    $$t = 5, 10, 15, 8, 16, 11, 19$$
    (Equations are in slide but none of the slots work, so this means task 4 is **not schedulable**)  
    Given this restriction on the 4th task, this means that these tasks **cannot be scheduled**

3. What about just the following using RM?:  
(50, 10), (80, 20), (110, 40)
    - SOLN:  
    Yes, since we already checked the first 3, and we saw they could all be scheduled. Do note though, the utilization is over 80% AAA (get computation, get schedule)

4. Consider the following system of independent preemptable periodic tasks:  
$T_1 = (3,1), T_2 = (5, 1), T_3 = (15, 3)$  
Check the schedulability of each task using a **necessary and sufficient condition**, using the Rate Monotonic algorithm
    - SOLN:  
    AAA (finish)
