Confidence Interval Continued
===

*t* Distribution
Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be a random sample from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and unknown variance $\sigma^2$. The random variable:  
$$T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{S / \sqrt{n}}$$  
has a *t* distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom
    - This is also a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution, like the normal distribution
    - Difference is that there is a **lower peak** and **fatter tail**, essentially spreading the data further
    - When $n \to \inf$, then $t \to N(0,1)$

Confidence Interval on the Mean, Variance Unknown
- If $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean of a random sample size *n* from a normal population with **unknown** variance $\sigma^2$, a $100(1-\alpha)$ confidence interval on $\mu$ is given by:  
$$\bar{x} - t_{\alpha/2, n-1} s/\sqrt{n} \leq \mu \leq \bar{x} + t_{\alpha/2, n-1} s/\sqrt{n}$$  
Where $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the upper $100 \alpha/2$ percentage point of the *t* distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom

Ex1: Assume we select 12 students from a population. The scores of their final exam have $\bar{x} = 77, s = 13.61$. Find a 95% confidence interval of the average score of the whole class.
- SOLN:  
Because $\sigma$ is unknown, and $n=12$ (not large enough to use a normal distribution), we should use the above equation:  
$$L = \bar{x} - t_{\alpha/2, n-1} s/\sqrt{n}, R = \bar{x} + t_{\alpha/2, n-1} s/\sqrt{n}$$  
We know all the values for this, except for $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$. To do this, we use the *t** distribution table on the following values:  
$$100(1-\alpha)% = 95%$$  
$$\alpha = 0.05$$  
$$\alpha/2 = 0.025, n-1 = 11$$  
This tells us that we need to find $t_{0.025, 11}$, looking at the table gets us:  
$$t_{0.025, 11} = 2.201$$  
Plugging this in, we get:  
$$L = 68.352, R=85.647$$  
**Therefore, our 95% confidence interval of $\mu$ is  (68.352, 85.647)**

Approximate Confidence Interval on a Binomial Proportion
- If $\hat{p}$ is the proportion of observations in a random sample of size *n* that belongs to a class of interest, an approximate $100(1- \alpha)%$ confidence interval on the proportion *p* of the population that belongs to this class is:  
$$\hat{p} - z_{\alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1- \hat{p})}{{n}} \leq p \leq \hat{p} + z_{\alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1- \hat{p}){n}}}$$  
where $z \alpha/2$ is the upper $\alpha/2$ percentage point of the standard normal distribution
    - We get this from a binomial distribution, $Bin(n,p)$, where *p* is the probability of success, *x* is the number of successes, and *n* is the sample size, giving us:  
    $$\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n}$$
    - We look for when *n* is large enough, and then use a normal distribution to approximate $Bin(n,p)$, looking for $np \gt 5, n(1-p) \gt 5$

Ex2: A random sample of 50 engineering students, 18 of them have a coding background. Find a 99% confidence interval for the proportion of all engineering students that have a coding background
- SOLN:  
Treat a coding background as a "success", giving us $x=18, n=50$  
Here, we can calculate the requirements given above:  
$$n \hat{p} = 50 * (18/50) = 18 \gt 5$$  
$$n (1 - \hat{p}) = 50 (1 - 18/50) = 32 \gt 5$$  
So, *n* is large enough and we can use this method, and can calculate the bounds as follows:  
$$L = \hat{p} - z_{\alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1- \hat{p}){n}}}, R = \hat{p} + z_{\alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1- \hat{p}){n}}}$$  
We get the alpha value as:  
$$100(1-\alpha) = 99%, \alpha = 0.01, \alpha/2 = 0.005$$  
Getting the normal table, we get:
$$z_{\alpha / 2} = 2.58$$  
Plugging in all values, we end up with  
$$L = 0.185, R=0.535$$
**Therefore, our 99% confidence interval of *p* is  (0.185, 0.535)**
