Chapter 3: Distributions
===

Review
- Flip 3 coins, let random var X be # of heads. We can then get P(X=0), P(X=1), P(x=2), and P(X=3), which forms our probability mass function (PMF), where *f*(0) = P(X=0), *f*(1) = P(X=1), etc.

New Questions
- Ex1: Inspection of 2 machines. The probability Machine 1 passes is 0.98, and the probability Machine 2 passes is 0.95. Let random variable X be the number of machines that passed the inspection
    - Q1: What is the pmf of X?  
    SOLN:  
    Remember, pmf is the function linking to the probability outcomes to a function:  
    $f(x_i) = P(X=x_i)$  
    It also requires the properties:  
    $0 \leq f(x_i) \leq 1$  
    $\sum_{x_i} f(x_i) = 1$  
    The possible values of our random variables is X = (0, 1, 2), therefore our pmf has values at:  
    $f(0) = P(X = 0) = (1-0.98) * (1-0.95) = **0.001**$
    $f(1) = P(X = 1) = P(\text{M1 pass} \cap \text{M2 fail}) + P(\text{M1 fail} \cap \text{M2 pass})$  
    $= (0.98)(1-0.95) + (1-0.98)(0.95)$  
    $= **0.068**$
    $f(2) = P(X = 2) = (0.98) * (0.95) = 0.931$  
    NOTE: We can use multiplication in f(0) and f(2) to combine the probability values since they are mutually exclusive events, each independent from one another. Addition is used in f(1) because they are separate cases unioned together, with no intersection to take away. A graph made in lecture to illustrate values is shown below:

    Q2: What is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of X?  
    SOLN:  
    cdf is given by the equation:  
    $F(x) = \sum_{x_i \lt x} = f(x_i)$  
    The cdf acts as a piecewise function, for each value of the pmf.  
    $F(x) = $  
    $0, x \lt 0 (-1)$  
    $f(0), 0 \leq x \lt 1 (0.5)$  
    $f(0) + f(1), 1 \leq x \lt 2 (1)$  
    $f(0) + f(1) + f(2), x \geq 2$  
    NOTE: The brackets after each piece are for test numbers in the range to plug into the cdf function, and find what is in the range.  
    This cdf then rounds out to  
    $F(x) =$  
    $0, x \lt 0 (-1)$  
    $0.001, 0 \leq x \lt 1 (0.5)$  
    $0.001 + 0.068 = 0.069, 1 \leq x \lt 2 (1)$  
    $0.001 + 0.068 + 0.931 = 1, x \geq 2$  
    NOTE2: The number of branches is always equal to the # of possible values of the random variable X + 1  
    $\text{# of branch} = \text{# of }X_i + 1$  
    Furthermore, the first value will always be 0, and the last will always be 1. Each value check in between will be in the form of  
    $a \leq x \lt c$  
    The graph of the cdf above is given below:

    Q3: What is the mean, variance, and standard deviation of X?  
    SOLN:  
    The mean/expected value can be represented in two symbols, shown below:  
    $\mu = E(x) = \sum_{x_i} x_i f(x_1)$  
    $= 0 f(0) + 1 f(1) + 2 f(2)$  
    $= 0*0.001 + 1*0.068 + 2*0.931$  
    $= 1.93$  
    The variance can also be shown in two symbols:  
    $\sigma^2 = V(x) = \sum_{x_i} (x_i - \mu)^2 f(x_i) = E[(X - \mu)^2]$  
    $ = (0 - 1.93)^2 * f(0) + (1 - 1.93)^2 * f(1) + (2 - 1.93)^2 * f(2)$  
    $ = 0.106624$  
    Finally, for standard deviation:  
    $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{0.106624}$
