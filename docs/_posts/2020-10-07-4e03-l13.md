Exponential Distribution
===

Going back through the example last lecture...
- Ex: Consider a server system with a single backup. The time to failure is exponentially distributed with mean 86.4hrs and repair times are exponentially distributed with mean 2.5hrs. When a server is failed, a backup server is (instantaneously) started. This server is identical in failure/repair characteristics. A server can only fail when operating.
    - State *i*: *i* servers failed
    - The time to go from state 0 to 1 or 1 to 2 is exponentially distributed as $\frac{1}{86.4}$, and going from state 2 to 1 and 1 to 0 is exponentially distributed as $\frac{1}{2.5}$
    - We can the **limiting probability** of a given state as:  
    $$\pi_j = lim_{i \rightarrow \inf} P_{ij}(t)$$  
    This would give the rate of transitions into a state, which should be equal to the rate of transitions out of a state
    - We can also put some values for transitions into *i*, $A_i(t)$, and the transitions out of *i*, $D_i(t)$
    - Furthermore, we also know the following:  
    $$\frac{D_i(t) - 1}{t} \leq \frac{A_i(t)}{t} \leq \frac{D_i(t) + 1}{t}$$  
    so the rate of transitions into state *i* should be equal to the rate of transitions leaving state *i*, or in other words, rate in = rate out
    - Examining state 0, the rate in is given as:  
    $$\pi_1 (\frac{1}{2.5})$$  
    Furthermore, the rate out is given as:  
    $$\pi_0 (\frac{1}{86.4})$$
    - Can work to get the limiting probability of all states, and then get the "global balance equations"

Ex: A system with fault detection is modelled as follows: When operating correctly, faults occur at a rate of 1/hr, with fault times being exponentially distributed. With probability 0.99, a fault is detected and recovery takes an exponentially distributed period of time with mean 1s. If the fault is not detected, recovery takes an exponentially distributed period of time with mean 5min. Calculate the limiting probability that the system is operating correctly
- MY SOLN: So, lets define state 0 as the state where all is operating correctly, state 1 as the state where fault occurs, 2 where a fault is detected and 3 where a fault isn't detected.
- ACTUAL SOLN:  
0: Correct operation  
1: Fault detected
2: Fault not detected  
$T_{01} = \frac{0.99}{3600}$ (Since 1hr is 1/3600s)
$T_{02} = \frac{0.01}{3600}$  
$T_{10} = 1$
$T_{20} = \frac{1}{300}$
- Solve for $\pi_0$:  
$$\frac{0.99}{3600} \pi_0 = \pi_1$$  
(The above comes from state 1, where the rate into 1 = rate out of 1, essentially just doing **Into = Out**)  
$$\frac{0.01}{3600}\pi_0 = \frac{1}{300}\pi_2$$  
(Same thing, just with state 2)  
$$\pi_0 + \pi_1 + \pi_2 = 1$$  
Solving all of the above for $\pi_0$, we get:  
$$\pi_0 = 0.9989$$

M/M/1 Queue
- Single server
- Arrivals follow a poisson process, rate $\lambda$
- Processing/service times follow $Exp(\mu)$ distributions (hence mean $1/\mu$)
- Infinite waiting room/buffer
- The M stands for markovian/memoryless, and usually is presented as M/M/1, or Arrivals/Processing Times/# of Servers
- Let $X(t)$ be the # of jobs in the system at time *t*
- The possible states (representing the number of jobs in the system) of are 0, 1, 2, ..., n
    - We claim this to be a CTMC, and to do this, we need to make a transition diagram with given rates for each transition:  
    $T_{01} = \lambda$  
    $T_{10} = \mu$  
    $T_{12} = \lambda$  
    $T_{21} = \mu$  
    This goes on for each state, since only one job can come in at a time
    - This is a description of a continuous time markov chain that captures the system behavior
- Balance equations for this will be done tomorrow
