User Analysis
===

**User Analysis**
- Determining what characteristics of our users may influence the design of an interface
    - What do we mean by *characteristics of our users?*
- Closely related to, but distinct from **task analysis**, analysing how user tasks are performed to influence design of our interface
    - User and task analysis usually done before designing takes place, can vary significantly
- User diversity includes
    - Abilities (physical, cognitive, etc)
    - Backgrounds
    - Socioeconomic
    - Motivations
    - etc.
- **Physical abilities**
    - Anthropometry studies human body measurements
        - Make design based on measurements, ie. phone based on hand sizes
    - Includes perception abilities
        - Low vs bright light, colours, response times, etc.
        - Similar concerns with hearing
- **Cognitive abilities**
    - Short/long-term memory, problem solving, decision making, reasoning, language comprehension, learning, etc.
        - Used more than the general idea of *intelligence*
        - All from Journal of Ergonomics Abstracts, which also includes fatigue, monotony, etc.
    - Most websites limit menus to 7 or so options
        - Most adults can hold 7 +/- 2 in their short-term memory
        - 5-9 menu items are ideal to stay in the person's head
- **Personalities**
    - Like intelligence, different taxonomies and ways to measure
        - Myers-Briggs (INTJ, ENTP, etc)
    - Some interfaces allow multiple organization methods
        - Messy vs organized, etc.
- **Cultural**
    - Beyond language translation, many other concerns when presenting information
        - Titles like Mr., Ms., etc.
        - Left-to-right vs right-to-left reading
        - Measurements
        - Dates
        - Metaphors (brutal)
        - Etiquette, tone, formality
- **Differently-abled users**
    - Vision impairments (screen readings, braille displays)
    - Hearing impairments (captioning)
    - Motor impairments (speech control)
        - Web guidelines required for accessible sites
- **Age**
    - Seniors (physical/cognitive abilities declining)
    - Accommodating seniors
        - Large font sizes, larger buttons, text descriptions under buttons, autocomplete suggestions, touchscreen over mouseHands full, cantÂ 
    - Children (age-limited abilities like reading, comprehension)
    - Accommodating children
        - Forster curiosity, intrinsic motivation
            - Explorable interfaces giving control, trying again without penalties
        - Safety concerns
            - Communication in interface? Not good
        - Dexterity and other abilities
            - Dragging? Double clicking? 
            - How long can they be expected to pay attention?
        - Flesch-Kincaid mentioned for measuring difficulty of a passage of text
- **Gender**
    - "No clear pattern of gender-related preferences in interfaces documented" (2016)
    - Certain video games draw different gender balances, but still inconclusive on most UI
- **Devices**
    - High speed vs low speed internet access
        - Is low speed accommodated?
        - Techniques exist to allow web servers to send smaller images to users to ease load
    - Display size and resolution?
        - Smartphones wih 3.5" screens vs 27" desktop screens, resolutions from 480p to 4K
        - Where responsive design can come in
    - Inputs: touchscreen vs mouse/keyboard
        - Recommended minimum size for "tappable" buttons

**Universal design**
- The design of products and environments to be usable by *all* people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need of adaptation or specialized design
    - More of a design philosophy than it is a goal
- Same idea for UI design
    - Removing mouse-only interactions like hovering
        - Helps with people with vision/motor impairment, can now be used on touchscreen
    - High contrast information display
        - Helps with vision impairment, also helping users in sunlight
    - Alt text on images
        - Helps screen reading programs, but also helps for bandwidth speed being too slow to send the image
- Should we always design for *everyone*?
    - No, since sometimes users are a very specified group, would not be worth it to make more universal access
        - Example being a "UI extreme" like a F-22 fighter jet, specific workplace users like EMTs/firefighters
    - Should always keep universal design at the top of your mind, practice when you can
- These cases are where **user analysis** becomes useful
    - Understanding our users better to influence our design

**User Research**
- Focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methods
    - Can be done before designing, after release, or on prototype stages
- A subset of research which do not require a working UI are conducted to find user analysis data
    - User analysis/research interchangeable
    - Done before design to influence it
- User research techniques
    - Individual interviews with users
    - Focus groups
    - Surveys
- Interviews/focus groups
    - High cost/time commitment per user
    - Less anonymity, if any
    - Can be exploratory, get follow-up questions
    - Qualitative, can see emotion in a user's face
- Surveys
    - Low cost/time commitment per user
    - Quantitative
        - Essentially giving data for each question
    - Can review questions for bias and other issues, more difficult to do with interviewers
        - People can be unknowingly bias
- Personas
    - Creation of a representative user based on available data, user interviews
    - Personal details are fictional, but data about users that is used to create it is not
    - How can it help
        - Makes a common reference point out of a lot of data
        - Helps to empathize with common user
    - Empirical evidence for persons as being effective
        - Some studies have come under criticism though so take it with a grain of salt
- Use cases
    - Descriptions on how users will perform tasks
    - Includes user's goals, steps, subtasks, how the UI can work, etc
        - Can be done with a UML diagram
- Card sorting
    - Helps to answer the question "what information is/should be associated with what other information
    - Helps to arrange website menus, workflows, navigation
    - Cards are informally arranged into a tree structure to represent data and relationships
