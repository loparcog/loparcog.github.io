Sample Spaces & Events
===

**Recap**
- Each week, several sections of the textbook will be covered
    - What will be covered in each lecture can be found in the `Lecture Schedule` section of the course page
    - Can then go through the textbook to look over what content will be covered, all units correspond to the textbook's sections
- Slides are a "shorter version" of the lecture notes, should still look @ class notes from 2019 to fully get all information


**Sample Space**

1. What is the sample space for a coin flip?  
SOLN:  
The sample space is all possible outcomes of an experiment, therefore:  
**S = {Heads, Tails} = {H, T}**  
NOTE: S is usually used to refer to a sample space, but sometimes Omega ($\Omega$) is also used

2. What is the sample space for flipping two coins?  
SOLN:  
The first coin flip can either be a H or a T, and the second can also be a H or a T. A tree diagram can be made to branch out to all possibilities.  
**S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}**

    - Many of these issues can get out of control very fast, recommended to always do a tree diagram to make sure you get everything
    - Is this sample space continuous or discrete?  
    SOLN:  
    **Discrete**, since it is limited and/or countably infinite.

3. Measure the height of a tree (not a sample space tree, just a regular tree). Sample space?  
SOLN:  
**S = {x | x $\geq$ 0}, this sample space is continuous**  
This doesn't give a unit though, so it should be  
**S = {x | x $\geq$ 0cm}**  
or  
**S = {x | 100000cm $\geq$ x $\geq$ 0cm}**  
NOTE: This experiment gives little to no information for assumptions, so we could assume the second to be correct. The third is more to display limits, as we can assume there isn't a tree taller than 100000cm.

- SIDE QUESTION: Is money continuous?  
SOLN:  
Depends what kind. If it is paying through cash and change, it is discrete, since there is a minimum measure of money ($0.01). However, for stock markets and for other types of money trading, there are commonly many decimals in an amount of money, with no defined minimum, so it would be continuous.

**Events**

1. Flip two coins, and give the event for...  
a) Getting one H  
SOLN:  
**E<sub>1</sub> = {HT, TH}**  
b) Getting two H  
SOLN:  
**E<sub>2</sub> = {HH}**  
c) The first coin is H  
SOLN:  
**E<sub>3</sub> = {HH, HT}**

**Rule of Sets** (this was reviewed in Week 1 notes)

1. Intersect (and): Outcomes in sets A **and** B, A $\cap$ B
2. Union (or): Outcomes in sets A **or** B, A $\cup$ B
3. Compliment (not): Outcomes **not** in A, A'
    - These can also all be displayed through venn diagrams
