Networks of Queues Continued
===

Recall...
- Closed Networks
    - *M* jobs in the system - none leave, no more enter
    - $r_i = 0, \sum_{j=1}^N P_{ij} = 1$  
    - Here, the traffic equations are:  
    $$\lambda_i = \sum_{j=1}^N P_{ji} \lambda_j$$

Solution for Closed Networks
- Problem: There is no unique solution for this set of equations
- Still have product-form solution, can use any valid (nonzero) solution to the traffic equations:  
$$\pi_{\bar{n}} = C \Pi_{i=1}^N (\frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_i})^{n_i}$$
- Need to calculate *C*, perhaps best seen through an example
    1. Solve traffic equations:  
    $$\lambda_1 = 0.6 \lambda_1 + 0.5 \lambda_2 + 0.4 \lambda_3$$
    $$\lambda_2 = 0.3 \lambda_1 + 0.6 \lambda_3$$  
    $$\lambda_3 = 0.1 \lambda_1 + 0.5 \lambda_1$$  
    Set $\lambda_1 = 1 \rightarrow \lambda_2 = 0.5143, \lambda_3 = 0.3571$
    2. Open systems would check that $\lambda_i \lt \mu_i$, but we don't need to do that for a closed network
    3. Solve for C:  
    $$C \sum_{n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 2} (\frac{1}{0.8})^{n_1} (\frac{0.5143}{0.6})^{n_2} (\frac{0.3571}{0.3})^{n_3}$$  
    Need to solve for all cases that $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 2$  
    Possible states for $(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ that satisfy the above: 6  
    $(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0)$  
    This then gives us the following (using the number of jobs at $n_i$ for the power of the equation):  
    $$\frac{1}{c} = (\frac{1}{0.8})^2 + (\frac{0.5143}{0.6})^2 + ...$$  
    $$= 0.1371$$
    - a) Solution:  
    $$C(\frac{0.5143}{0.6})^2 = 0.1007$$  
    - b) Solution:
    $$\mu_1 P(\text{node 1 busy})$$  
    We can get this probability by calculating the value for all of the states where node 1 is busy: (2, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), and (1, 0, 1):  
    $$= \mu_1 C((\frac{1}{0.8})^2 + ...)$$  
    $$= 0.4521$$  
    We can do a sanity check that the utilization rate is less than the throughput:  
    $$= 0.4521 \lt 0.8$$

BCMP Networks
- The furthest that we can push the product-form solution - see accompanying notes for more info
- Can make the following relaxations:
    - Scheduling discipline
    - Processing time distribution
    - Load-dependent processing rates
    - Classes allowed (different routes)

Mean Value Analysis (not really needed just for info)
- Numerical solutions for product-form networks
    - For a closed network, we know that:  
    $$\pi_{\bar{n}} = C \pi_1 (n_1) \pi_2 (n_2) ... \pi_N(n_N)$$  
    where,  
    $$\pi_i (n_i) = (\frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_i})^{n_i}$$  
    and $\lambda_1$ is a solution to the traffic equations  
    $$\lambda_i = \sum_{k=1}^N \lambda_k P_{ki}$$
    - There is difficulty in evaluating C, as we have:  
    $$C = \sum_{\bar{n}} \Pi_{i=1}^{N} \pi_i(n_i)$$  
    This quickly gets into many terms, and this expression does not simplify
- Motivation
    - Mean response time at node *i*:  
    $$E[T_i] = \frac{1}{\mu_i} + \frac{1}{\mu_i} * (\text{mean # of jobs present on arrival})$$
    - Memoryless property is crucial, otherwise need to know information about the elapsed time on a job in process
- Arrival Theorem
    - $E[T_i^{(m)}]$ is defined to be the mean response time at node *i* for a network with *m* jobs:  
    $$E[T_i^{(m)}] = \frac{1}{\mu_i} + \frac{1}{\mu_i} E[N_i^{m-1}]$$  
    - Relates a network with *m* jobs present to one with (*m*-1) jobs present
    - Recursive approach possible?
    - Need to bridge the gap
- Bridging the Gap
    - Consider a network with *M* users, each with think times with mean *Z*
    - User submits requests to a server with *N* nodes
    - System throughput with $m \leq M$ jobs in the system is given in an equation (in lecture notes)
    - Little's Law application on this equation gives us:  
    $$E[N_i^{(m)}] = E[T_i^{(m)}] V_i X$$
- The MVA Algorithm
    - Combine the equations to get the alg
    - First, set:  
    $$E[N_i^{(0)}] = 0, i = 1, ..., N$$  
    Then, for $m= 1...M$:  
    $$E[T_i^{(m)}] = \frac{1}{\mu_i} + \frac{1}{\mu_i} R[N_i^{(m-1)}], i = 1, ..., N$$  
    $$X(m) = \frac{m}{Z + \sum_{i=1}^N} V_i E[T_i^{(m)}]$$  
    $$E[N_i(m)] = E[T_i^{(m)}] V_i X, i = 1, ..., N$$
