Real Time Systems and Control Applications
===

Quiz
- After `fork()` is called...
    - Can child process access the data created by parent process before `fork()`?
        - Yes, but the modification can be seen only in the child process, the parent will not be changed
    - Is data allocated on the heap (dynamically allocated memory) before `fork()` call also available to the child?
        - Yes, the memory on the heap is copied, and the child will point to its own heap memory

Further Multithread Work
- Variables can be called by pointers to change directly in threads, not in forks though
    - If using the `#include <pthread.h>` header, you must compile with `-pthread`
- **Race Condition**
    - An error condition in parallel programs, where the outcome of a program changes as the relative scheduling of different control flows varies
    - Generally, race conditions can happen when the ordering of events can affect the outcome of some computation
    - Causes outcome to not be predictable or repeatable
    - These can be avoided using some thread-safe locks, like semaphores
- Event Driven Programming
    - Code examples in the slides using signals and threads/forks
