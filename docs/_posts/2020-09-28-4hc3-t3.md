Bootstrap Tutorial
===

Bootstrap
- A way to quickly design a and customize responsive, mobile-first sites
    - Saves dev time, consistent, and customizable
- Can be used locally by downloading the files, or you can link it through CDN
    - CDN is most commonly used, easiest to implement
    - Also more universally usable, don't expect the host to have the files
- Both documentation and examples can be found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs)
- Once linked to the documents, elements can be made directly as HTML values set to specific classes so Bootstrap knows how to format them
    - Can do further editing of values by getting the element in a JS block later
