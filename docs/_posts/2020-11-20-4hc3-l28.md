UI Design Patterns
===

UI Design Patterns
- Reusable solutions that solve commonly occurring problems
- Design patterns commonly used in software architecture
    - Also in UI design and UI software architectures
- Breadcrumbs
    - Linked labels that show the user their current location in the website's hierarchy 
    - Secondary navigation, should not be used as primary navigation tools
    - Can be used when page structures are hierarchical, with sections divided into subsections
- Lazy Registration
    - Signing up to a web app is a significant barrier/commitment to the user
    - Used when users can access the web app tasks without having to register
        - Registration can come when necessary, or piece by piece when needed
- Forgiving Format
    - Allows users to enter data in different formats (city, postal code, etc)
    - Would use this when... 
        - the input relates to one topic such as location or date/time
        - it is better than dropdown lists, checkboxes, or other alternatives
- Progressive Disclosure
    - When not all information is disclosed to the user at once, and the user can choose to dig deeper for more info
        - eg. "view all replies" instead of displaying alls
    - Lowers cognitive load and prevents the user from being overwhelmed
- Steps Left
    - Shows the users the number of remaining steps they have left in a process
    - Want to use this when a task can be broken up into multiple steps, but we want to ensure the user the process will not be unreasonable in length
    - Wouldn't do this in one or two step processes, or processes that don't need explanation

UI Design Patterns
- Can catagorize UI patterns as related to input, navigation, social, etc.
    - Collections exist online, like the ones [at this site](ui-patterns.com/patterns)
- Can view design patterns as another tool in our design toolbox for helping us make design decisions
- Overlap with UI guidelines and principles a lot
    - *Especially* guidelines
- Can also overlap with concepts like gameification (eg. leaderboards)
- Can be a bit "dangerous" when used by beginners
    - Using design patterns != good design
    - Beginners less likely to recognize this
- Design patterns need to be used to solve the right problems, the larger context in which they're used still needs to be considered
- Password Strength Meters
    - Provides a visual representation with colour and length as to a password's strength
    - Can help users to choose more secure passwords
    - Can provide an easy understanding to complex password rules
- Cards
    - Container for a few short, related pieces of information
    - Roughly resembles a playing card in size and shape, and is intended as a linked, short representation of a conceptual unit
    - Group information together and potentially have varying lengths
    - Particularly useful when a flexible layout is required, or when information is heterogeneous
    - Lists are easier to scan than cards, layout is more predictable
        - Cards don't have an order, hard to follow
        - Cards take up more space
        - Lists better for searches and comparisons and when data is homogeneous

Software Architecture Patterns
- Several software arch design patterns are relevant for constructing UIs
- Example being single page applications, discussed before
    - Can also be things like MVC
- Also discussed component-based architecture
    - React is an example of this
    - This would be an example of an *architectural style* as opposed to a design pattern, it is a broader and less specific approach to constructing a software

Anti-Patterns
- Common response to recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive
- In other words, anti-patterns are things that *seem* like a good idea, but are actually a poor idea
    - Can be subjective
- Also found in UI design, software architecture and other areas
- Click Here
    - Users are given a link with the text "click here"
    - Link text should be descriptive, otherwise user is unsure on where it will lead
    - What if the user isn't using a mouse?
- Dark Patterns
    - Deceptive interface designs to trick the user into doing things they would not normally do
    - Avoid due to ethical reasons
    - Used deliberately to trick users to get money/subscriptions/information etc.
- Sneak into the Basket
    - When an extra item is added to a shopping card without the user explicitly requesting it
    - Forces the user to deliberately remove the item if they don't want it
    - User may not even be aware and go through
- Privacy Zuckering
    - When you are tricked into revealing more information than you intended
    - Named after Mark Zuckerberg for accusation of FB privacy issues
    - eg. not having a cancel option, giving the illusion of choice
- Confirm Shaming
    - When users are shamed for not confirming an option
    - It works by "guilting" users into compliance
    - The "opt out" option is typically less prominent or even hard to find
- Disguised Ads
    - Advertisements that look like they are content or navigation in order to trick you into clicking them
        - eg. "Start download" button ads
    - Takes users to a website where they'll be sold something
    - Often ads will look like a download button or some sort of desirable content
