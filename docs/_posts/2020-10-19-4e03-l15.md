M/M/1 Queue Balance Equations Continued
===

Birth-Death Process
- Suppose that $\lambda_n is the rate out of state $n$, to state $n+1$, and $\mu_n$ is the rate out of state $n$ to state $n-1$
- This is known as a "Birth-Death Process" - the $\lambda$ values are the birth rates, and the $\mu$ values are the death rates.
    - Essentially the rates of going up a state or down a state from a given state

**Local Balance Equations** 
- local balance equations are given as follows:  
$$\lambda_0\pi_0 = \mu_1\pi_1$$  
$$\lambda_1\pi_1 = \mu_2\pi_2$$  
...  
$$\lambda_n \pi_n = \mu_{n+1}\pi_{n+1}$$
- Using these, we can then write $\pi_n$ in terms of $\pi_0$:  
$$\pi_n = \frac{\lambda_0\lambda_1\lambda_2 ... \lambda_{n-1}}{\mu_1\mu_2 ... \mu_n} \pi_0$$  
So,  
$$\pi_0 = \frac{1}{1 + \sum^{\inf}_{n=1} \Pi_{i=1}^n \frac{\lambda{i-1}}{\mu_1}}$$
- This is the general solution for the Birth-Defect process

M/M/1/N - Finite Buffer System
- Arriving jobs (beyond *N* in system) "lost" or "blocked"
- Lost jobs do **not** return at a later time
- Transition rates:  
$$\lambda_n = \lambda, n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1$$  
$$\mu_n = \mu, n = 1, 2, 3, ..., N$$
- How do we solve this?  
$$\pi_n = (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n \pi_0, 0 \leq n \leq N$$  
$$\pi_0 = \frac{1}{\sum_{n=0}^N (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n}$$  
Rewriting the above... 
$$\pi_0 = \frac{1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu}}{1 - (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^{N + 1}}
- Substitute $\pi_0$ in the first expression to get $\pi_n$
    - Also note the summation needs to be finite so the fraction does not go to infinity, but there are no conditions on lambda over mu, so it is **always** finite
- Blocking Probabilities
    - Blocking probability is the probability that the system is full, which is $\pi_N$ here. The mean number of jobs lost per unit time is thus $\lambda \pi_n$. There's a table in the slides, but essentially as $\lambda/\mu$ increases, so does $\pi_N$

M/M/Infinity Queue
- Represents a system with an infinite number of servers
- Still has *M* processes distributed by a poisson process, with a single queue of infinite size
    - Also known as "self service", no wait to get processed
- Arrivals follow a poisson process with rate $\lambda$
- Processing time is exponentially distributed as $Exp(\mu)$
    - No waiting for processing
- State is the # of jobs in the system (0 to infinity)
    - Rate of going from state *n* to state *n+1* is $\lambda$
        - Same as M/M/1
    - Rate of going from 1 to 0 is $\mu$  
    - Rate of going from 2 to 1 is $2 \mu$
    - Rate of going from 3 to 2 0s $3 \mu$
        - This is what comes from having an infinite server size and 0 wait, all depending on the processing time of the currently running processes
    - $Y_2$: Minimum of two processing times
- The equation for an M/M/Inf queue is seen as:  
$$\pi_n = (\Pi_{i=1}^n \frac{\lambda}{i\mu}) \pi_0$$  
$$= \frac{1}{n!} (\frac{\lambda}{\mu}) \pi_0$$  
$$\pi_0 = e^{-\lambda/\mu}$$
    - A further equation before is on this
    - Comes from a Taylor Series expansion
- The final limiting distribution is thus:  
$$\pi_n = \frac{1}{n!}(\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n e^{-\lambda/\mu}$$
    - This is a Poisson distribution with mean E[N]
    - By Little's Law, E[T] = 1/\mu
    - Could get E[T] by noting that there is no waiting in queue, therefore:  
    $$E[N_Q] = E[T_Q] = 0$$

M/M/c Queue
- System has c processors in parallel and a queue for additional jobs
    - Rate of going down states looks the same as inf queue, up to the number of servers available
- Functions given as follows:  
$$\pi_n = \frac{1}{n!}(\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n \pi_0, n \leq c$$  
$$\pi_0 = \frac{1}{c! c^{n-c}} (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n \pi_0, n \geq c$$  
$$pi_0 = [1 + \sum_{n=1}^{c-1} \frac{1}{n!} (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n + \frac{1}{c!}(\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^c (\frac{1}{1-\rho})]^{-1}$$  
    - This last one is where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{c\mu} \lt 1$
- Expressions for this formula is a complete mess, even for averages
- Ending on Erlang-C formula, will go over more tomorrow
