User Interface Design Goals
===

**Usability**
- What is usability? What does it mean for something to have "good usability"?
    - Example: for manipulating a file system, what is better: GUI or CLI?
    - CLI users need to remember commands, nothing to indicate how things will work and what to do, learning curve
    - GUI is more intuitive, intentional design decision to use "folders" and "files" since those were things used in the business world commonly before shifting to computer interfaces
- There are many potential coals for UIs, together they make up usability (usability is more than "ease of use")
- We can organize these goals in different taxonomies, ie. categories:
    - **Lernability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish a basic task?
    - **Retention**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re-establish proficiency?
        - We can call this goal **memorability**
    - **Performance**: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
    - **Error Rates**: How many errors do users make, how severe are they, and how easily can users recover from these?
    - **Subjective Satisfaction**: How *pleasant* is it to use the design?
    - **Accessibility**: How accessible is the interface to differently-abled users?
    - **Functionality**: What range of operations does the UI support?
        - Different than "the quality of being suited to serve a purpose well", specifically referring to *how much it can do*
    - **Trustability**: How much do users trust the interface (ie. get users to put in their credit card info)?
- **UI Design Goals vs Requirements**
    - **Functional Requirements** are the required behaviours of a system, what it can do
    - **Non-Functional Requirements** are criteria to just the *operation* of a system, ie. scalability, testability, maintainability, etc.
        - UI design goals are closely related to the idea of non-functional requirements (aka **quality attributes**)
        - Functionality is tied to functional requirements though
        - Specific goals might be captured with tangible requirements
- This design goal taxonomy is only one type, there are others out there, ie. Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Satisfaction
    - Can represent the same ideas, just more abstract
- Other categories of goals can be given like safety, understandability, responsiveness, etc., but most of these would fall into categories we've already defined in our taxonomy.
- What was the **most important** usability goal when designing the following interfaces? (Chat votes)
    - CT Machine: Error rates
    - Fortnite: Subjective satisfaction
    - Netflix: Learnability
- Can interfaces be expected to satisfy every usability goal to the maximum amount possible?
    - No! We need trade-offs
- **Trade-offs** occur when we sacrafice quality in one goal to improve quality for another goal
    - Virtually all UIs of enough sophistication need to use trade-offs
- Example with Android vs iOS, setting up a hotspot from your phone
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/and-ios.png)
    - iOS traded off some functionality in exchange for improved performance (no extra tap to save, less options to think about, network name is automatic) and error rates (iOS won't let you configure your way into a problem)
    - iOS ecosystem has also notably made device-to-device learnability stronger
- Is the trade-off worth it?
    - This one decision probably doesn't matter, but this philosophy is applied OS-wide, and Apple does have almost a 23% market share of smartphones so they probably have something right
- It's important for us to be able to **measure goals**
    - Helps to see if one design is better than another, if a decision will improve a UI
    - Compare interfaces **objectively**
- Not straightforward sadly
    - What performance measures and error rates matter from one system to the next?
    - How to measure subjective satisfaction, learnability, trustability, and less objective goals?
- **Performance**
    - How long does it take a user to perform a task? How many clicks/taps to perform a task? How many tasks can be done in a given time period?
- **Error rates**
    - Errors per task, errors per time period
    - Success rate at completing task 
- **Subjective satisfaction, trustability**
    - Surveys can help make it objective!
        - Look through short answers, yes/no options
        - **Likert scale questions**, rate your agreement to the following statement questions, "I liked using this interface", etc.
            - Can compute an average on this and compare with others
- **Learnability, Retention**
    - Perform an experiment: ask users who never saw the interface before to perform a task
        - Measure how long it takes, compute an average, and compare
- It is possible to measure goals, even relatively subjective ones!

- Practice assignment is out, due Sunday September 13th @ 11:59PM
    - Ungraded, can be submitted without grading, helpful to see if you are understanding content
- Assignment #1 is out, due Sunday September 20th @ 11:59PM
    - Pick an interface and make a 3-6 minute video demonstrating and analyzing an interface, critiquing it based on the design goals
    - Ideally submit on youtube as an unlisted video, can also do an MP4 though
