Digital Control Systems and Z-Transforms
===

Goals
- Introduce suitable mathematical models for analysis on discrete systems, so that we can build on the existing knowledge of continuous systems (CCS)
- How can we convert CCS transfer functions into equivalent transfer functions for DCS?
- If a stable CCS is transformed into a DCS, will it remain stable after conversion?

Sampling (Analog to Digital Converter)
- The analog signal is thus represented by a sequence of sampled values
- The conversion of analog signal takes place repetitively at instants of time that are *T* seconds apart
    - *T* is called the **sampling period**, and 1/*T* is called the **sampling rate** (cycles/s)
- The accuracy of the digital signal depends on the number of bits used to represent the samples
- **Sampling**: The process of taking values at discrete time intervals
- Amplitude values are represented using binary numbers AAA (finish)

Sampled Data System
- Input signals are available only at sample intervals of time (A2D conversion)
- Thus, the reference input *r* is a sequence of sample values $r(kT)$, instead of $r(t)$
- AAA (finish)
