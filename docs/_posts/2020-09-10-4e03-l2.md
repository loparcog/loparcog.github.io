Performance Analysis of Computer Systems 4E03
===

Prof: Douglas Down / downd@mcmaster.ca

Outline
- Office hours will be done all through teams, a meeting will be started and anyone can join, although appointments will also be possible
- Textbook is optional, but a great resources. It goes well beyond what is taught in the course (course only goes through about 30-40%)
    - *Performance Modeling and Design of Computer Systems*, by Mor Harchol-Balter
- Peer-reviews will be out of lecture, essentially like side-assignments
    - Kritik is a student-cost based program, so we will need to pay $20 to access the tool
- Course will cover things like markov chains, simulation, multiserver systems, load balancing, and more.

Grading
- Midterm > 25% (One midterm, date TBA)
    - Take-home midterm, no proctoring
    - Date will be decided by poll, after break week, probably around late October, latest early November
- Assignments > 15% (weekly, 11 assignments, but your mark is the best 6/11, welcome to collaborate)
- Peer-review activities > 15% (done through 'Kritik', open-ended work marked by one another, will be discussed further next week)
- Final Exam > 45% (2.5h, date TBA)
    - Also take-home

**A Crash Course in Probability**
- Most of this will be in more depth in a stats course, but this will give enough to bootstrap to start going into performance models
    - Feel free to follow up with any questions to prof
- Samples and sample spaces
    - **Sample space** is all possible things that can happen, and a **sample** is a realization of these things (also known as an **experiment**)
    - Example, suppose there's a data center with three servers (A, B, C)
        - At any (random) time, we can see which servers are working and which have failed
    - **Experiment**: Which servers are up, which are down?
    - **Sample Space $\Omega$**: The set of all possible samples/outcomes  
    $\Omega$: {(w, w, w), (w, w, f) ... (f, f, w), (f, f, f)}  
    with each indicating if A, B, C is working (w) or failed (f)
- An **event**, E, is any subset of the sample space, $\Omega$
    - $E_1$ corresponds to Server A failed:  
    $E_1$ = {(f, w, w), (f, f, w), (f, w, f), (f, f, f)}
    - $E_2$ corresponds to at least two servers failed:  
    $E_2$ = {(f, f, w), (f, w, f), (w, f, f), (f, f, f)}
    - Unions and intersections also exist in events:  
    $E_1 \cap E_2$ = {(f, w, f), (f, f, w), (f, f, f)}
    - Complement of an event is also an event:
    $E_2'$ = {(w, w, w), (w, w, f), (w, f, w), (f, w, w)}
- Events don't mean much on their own, only giving possible outputs
    - Need probabilities to give it basis
- **Probabilities**
    - 0 $\leq$ P{E} $\leq$ 1: Probability of event E occurring
- Suppose we have the given probabilities:  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4e03/num1.png)
    - P{$E_1$} = 0.0300 + 0.0030 + 0.0030 + 0.0010 = 0.0370
    - P{$E_1 \cap E_2$} = 0.0030 + 0.0030 + 0.0010 = 0.0070
- Union probabilities:  
    P{E $\cup$ F} = P{E} + P{F} - P{E $\cap$ F}
    - This is to cancel out any duplicate events giving more probability
- **Union Theorem**:  
P{E $\cup$ F} $\leq$ P{E} + P{F}
    - Equality, when E $\cap$ F = $\emptyset$, when E and F are *mutually exclusive*
- **Conditional Probability**: The conditional probability of event E **given** event F is written as P{E\|F}, and is given by the following:  
P{E\|F} = $\frac{P\(E \cap F\)}{P\(F\)}$
- Example: Compute the probability that A is failed given that exactly one server is failed  
SOLN:  
F is the information we have (one server has failed), and E is the event we want to find given F (A is failed)  
F = {(f, w, w), (w, f, w), (w, w, f)}  
E = {(f, w, w), (f, f, w), (f, w, f), (f f f)}  
$\frac{P \( E \cap F \) }{P\(F\)}$ = $\frac{0.0300}{0.0300 + 0.0600 + 0.0500}$ = 0.2143
- **Independent Events**
    - Events E and F are independent if  
    P{E $\cap$ F} = P{E} P{F}
- P{E} is not affected by whether F occurs or not. Also captured through conditional probability:  
P{E|F} = $\frac{P\(E \cap F\)}{P\(F\)}$ = $\frac{P\(E\)P\(F\)}{P\(F\)}$ = P{E}
- Example 1: Are the events that server A is failed (E) and server B is failed (F) independent?
