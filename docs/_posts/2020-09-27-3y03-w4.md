Probability Density Functions / Cumulative Distribution Function
- Probability Density Functions
    - **Continuous Random Variable**: A random variable with an interval (finite or infinite) with real numbers in its range
    - For a continuous random variable *X*, a **probability density function** is a function such that:
        1. $f(x) \geq 0$
        2. $\int_{-\inf}^{\inf} f(x) dx = 1$
        3. $P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx =$ area under f(x) fro *a* to *b* for any *a* and *b*
    - **Histogram**: An approximation to a probability density function
        - An example would be for *X* as a continuous random variable, and any *a* and *b*:  
        $P(a \leq X \leq b) = P(a \lt X \leq b) = P(a \leq X \lt b) = P(a \lt X \lt b)$
- Cumulative Distribution Function
    - For a continuous random variable *X*, the **cumulative distribution function** is:  
    $F(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-inf}^x f(u) du$  
    (For $-\inf \lt x \lt \inf)
        - The probability density function can be determined from the cumulative distribution function by differentiating:  
        Given F(x), $f(x) = \frac{dF(x)}{dx}$, as long as the derivative exists

Mean/Variance of a Continuous Random Variable (CRV)
- Suppose that *X* is a continuous random variable, with probability density function $f(x)$
    - The mean/expected value of *X* is:  
    $\mu = E(X) = \int_{-\inf}^{\inf} x f(x) dx$
    - The variance of *X* is:
    $\sigma^2 = V(X) = \int_{-inf}^{\inf} (x-\mu)^2 f(x) dx = \int_{-inf}^{\inf} x^2 f(x) dx - \mu^2
- Furthermore, we can compute the expected value with a random variable function as follows:  
$E[h(X)] = \int_{-inf}^{inf} h(x) f(x) dx$
    - In the special case that $h(X) = aX + b$, for any constants *a* and *b*, then:  
    $E[h(X)] = aE(X) + b$

Distributions
- **Continuous Uniform Distribution**
    - A continuous random variable *X* with probability density function  
    $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, a \leq x \leq b$  
    is a **continuous uniform random variable**
    - The functions for this distribution are
        - avg:  
        $\mu = E(X) = \int_a^b \frac{x}{b-a} dx = \frac{a + b}/2$
        - var:  
        $\sigma^2 = V(X) = \int_a^b \frac{(x - \frac{a+b}{2})^2}{b-a} dx = \frac{(b-a)^2}/12$
    - The cumulative distribution function is also given as follows

- **Normal Distribution**
    - A continuous random variable *X* with probability density function  
    $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma}} e^{\frac{-(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}, -\inf \lt x \lt \inf$  
    is a **normal random variable** with parameters $\mu$ where $\-inf \lt x \lt \inf$ and $\sigma \gt 0$
    - The functions for this distribution are
        - avg:  
        $E(X) = \mu$
        - var:  
        $V(X) = \sigma^2
    - A normal random variable with $\mu =0, \sigma^2 = 1$ is a **standard normal random variable**, and is denoted by *Z*
    - The cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable is given as:  
    $\omega(z) = P(Z \leq z)$
    - A normal random variable can be standardized by the following:  
    $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
        - This can be used in probability values as follows:  
        $P(X \leq x)$  
        $= P(\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \leq \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})$  
        $= P(Z \leq z)$
