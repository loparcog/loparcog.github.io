Linux Kernel Model
===

Execution Context
- To this point, we have assumed no differentiation between jobs executed at a processor
    - For most operating systems, this is not the case
- For the Linux kernel, jobs at a CPU can be in one of three contexts:
    1. User context - executing user code
    2. Kernel context - executing OS code
    3. Driver context - executing driver code
    - Each would have their own specific queues, with jobs differing on execution times and "workflow"
- Note this system will violate some assumptions we've been using, so be wary

Transitions Between Contexts
- Jobs enter in kernel context
    - From user context, jobs always enter in kernel context
- From kernel context, three possibilities: enter user context $(p_{user})$, enter driver context $(p_{io})$, or complete processing $(p_{done} = 1 - p_{user} - p_{io})$
- From driver context, either enter kernel context $(p_{driverdone})$ or enter I/O context $(1 - p_{driverdone})$
- From I/O context, jobs always enter driver context
    - Some notes, user, kernel, and driver context jobs are all executed by a single processor, while I/O context jobs are executed by a device
    - Time spent in driver and kernel contexts is much much less than the time spent in the user context

Prioritization of Contexts
- The Linux kernel prioritizes the contexts at the CPU as follows:
    1. The driver context has highest priority
    2. The kernel context has middle priority
    3. The user context has lowest priority
    - Essentially, driver > kernel > user
- The user context is preempted by the other two contexts but the kernel context **cannot be preempted** by the driver context
    - So in this context, **nothing** can preempt a kernel context
