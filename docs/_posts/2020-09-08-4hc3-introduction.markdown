Human Computer Interfaces CS4HC3/SE4HC3
---

Prof: Kevin Browne / brownek@mcmaster.ca

About
- PHD in HCI @ Mac
- Masters w/ IBM, worked with Playstation 3 chip
- Prof @ Mohawk College
- Sessional instructor at McMaster, taught this back in 2011
    - Just started as assistant professor this term for Mac
- Big emphasis on aiding people (games to help adults learn, outreach program for kids to learn coding)

Friendster Example
- "Facebook before facebook"
    - Got 10s of millions of users, but failed
    - Made by a McMaster graduate
- Facebook was not the downfall to Friendster though, UX was the issue
    - Pages took more than half a minute to load, "loading a single page was an agonizing chore"
    - Articles from 2003 - 2004

Critical Examples
- Jenny a little girl was discharged from cancer ward, program users didn't notice some sort of health levels were wrong, and let her go unknowingly, where she passed later on due to this oversight
- Air France A330-200 crashed, killing 228 on board in 2009
    - Lack of tactile feedback to let the  pilot sync up and know where to go

Individual Impacts
- 1 in 5 to 1 in 3 divorces blamed on facebook/social media
    - Something about these interfaces promoting anti-social behaviours?

Impacts on Society
- Robot drone going around to deter homeless encampments
- Students getting wifi from a Taco Bell for internet
    - Decisions made in these systems impact people more than usually expected

Interfaces still good though!
- Tech allows us to run this class, run programs and such in COVID
- Khan Academy, e-commerce, Google, Netflix, Wikipedia, lots of information and tools, "software is eating the world"
    - But this is all software, what about UI and UX?
    - Explained in GUI
- Accessible user interfaces allowing people to experience things that they may have not been able to experience before (ie. Xbox Accessible Controllers)

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Xerox Alto was the first desktop GUI, made in 1973, a decade before main ones
- Facebook and such is a bunch of data just surrounded by a UI, promoting sharing and connecting
- Twitter blocking tweets to 140 characters and only to text/picture messages moved it to more of a news consumption service

Human Computer Interfaces
- Space where interaction between humans and computers occurs
    - Not just hardware
- Field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) intersects with many fields, such as:
    - Comp Sci, Software Eng
    - Psychology
    - Graphic Design
    - Business / Ergonomics

Why Study Human Computer Interfaces?
- How do we design and build better software?
- Why are some interfaces better than other interfaces?
    - How can we make design decisions to improve our software? How do we know which decision is a better design decision?
- Why does some software succeed/fail?
- How can we make it accessible, improve human lives, reduce risk/harm?
- If you're using quicksort vs mergesort, the end user doesn't really care, it's the execution time that the user notices.
- Being able to solve these issues allows for
    - Great career opportunities
        - Many successful projects depend on a solid HCI
    - Critical to big picture thinking, how to communicate and how to work up in software work and the software world
    - Modern agile software development depends on quickly displaying new tools with an accessible interface to display tools

How Do We Study HCIs?
- Talk about UI design goals, how to analyze UIs and situations to identify why some goals may interfere with one another
- Discuss and apply theories principles and heuristics for designing UIs
- Discuss and apply solutions to commonly occurring problems in UI development
- Identify and avoid common problems
    - "Anti-patterns"
- Design UI with low fidelity (drawing on paper) and high fidelity (wire frame model) tools, using modern tech and libraries
- Participate in testing UIs, studying design
- Will be a lot of application as well to learn, like with the project later in the semester
    - Not making website backends or all, just mainly frontend tools
    - Will be well-supported in terms of coding
- Tutorials will have live coding examples
    - Ideally will allow us to build solutions independently, will give us the base and it is on us to further our knowledge
- Reflective Questions will be given during lecture
    - Helps retain information, no marks related or anything, just good to do
- Ungraded Practice Opportunities will also be done out of lecture to allow for a chance to see if what you're doing is right w/o putting marks on the line
- Some collaboration and gamification in lectures, games (ie Kahoot) will have prizes
- Project will be given freedom on what you want to build, avoiding making something you've been told to build
    - More on Friday
- Emphasis on "Active Learning", trying to focus on making sure that we are involved and forcing us to know if we did or did not understand a topic
    - Don't be discouraged when you get something wrong, note to go over it or ask about it later on

What Will We Cover?
- UI design goals
- Mockups/wireframing/prototyping
- Users, tasks, user research
- Accessible design
- Design heuristics, principles, theories
- Design thinking
- UI design process
- UI testing and implementation
    - Avoid the code, look more into the tech and related architectures
- User help
    - Videos, manuals, etc.
- HCI research/case studies
- Recent/future HCI developments

Tech Used
- Front-end web dev
    - HTML/CSS
    - JS
    - ReactJS
        - No expectations on writing back-end (server) code, may be given some to use
- Less in depth, but some notes on game engines, mobile app dev, chat bots, etc
    - Beyond practical matter that these are popular types of interfaces, interfaces are just more abstract of an idea
    - Look at deep theories about design across many interface types

Course Expectations
- Only one HCI course, it's a breadth course
    - Try to leave you with a little bit of everything, act as a base to build off of
- Large variance in student background, abilities, and interests

Course Mark Breakdown
- Assignments > 35% (7 assignments x 5%)
- Project > 35%
    - Milestones with different weights over the term, done individually or in groups
- Final Exam > 30%

Materials
- No required textbook
    - Weekly required readings instead
    - Some recommended books
        - Free from McMaster Library

Logistics
- Using Teams and Avenue as primary mediums
    - Questions in lecture may be done after lecture, or by TA during lecture
- Course questions can go in the avenue discussion page
- Lectures
    - More focussed on design/theory
    - Cover high level implementation
    - Guest speakers
- Tutorials
    - More focussed on practical implementation
    - Learning tech to implement interfaces, chance to follow along TA solution
- Roughly one assessment due per week
- One "Get out of Jail Free" card for a no questions asked 7 day extension
    - Also can just submit 3 days late, 10% penalty per day

# TODO
- First reading already posted
    - Intro to HTML and CSS, required for tutorial on Monday
- UI goals and assignment #1 on thursday
- Prototyping and project intro on Friday

Also a game tool company he pointed to to help kids learn compsci @ [Prodigy Game](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/)
