**General System**
- A set of interacting or independent component parts forming a complex/intricate whole
    - In control system and applications, **response delay** is an important characteristic of the given system  
    Input > System > Output
- A **computing system** takes inputs and with programs and storage processes a result
    - Some characteristics of a computing system is accuracy, functionality, robustness, usability, response speed (delay), etc.
- **Real-Time System (RTS)**
    - **Response time**: Time interval between a stimulus/input and the corresponding response/output
    - "A system where a **timely** response to external stimuli is vital"
        - What is meant by "timely"?
    - A system that must satisfy <ins>explicit response-time constraints</ins>, otherwise severe consequences may occur, including failure.
- **Classification of RTS**
    - A **soft** RTS is one where performance is degraded but not destroyed by failure to meet response-time constraints
        - Ex. streaming videos, computer games, online chatting
    - A **firm** RTS is one in which missing a few deadlines will not lead to total failure, but missing more than a few may lead to complete and catastrophic system failure
        - Ex. Manufacturing systems with robot assembly lines, coursework submissions
    - A **hard** RTS is one which failure to meet a single deadline may lead to complete and catastrophic system failure  
        - Ex. Mission critical systems, nuclear systems, medical applications such as pacemakers
    - Cost for missing deadlines is increasing from soft to hard

- **Comments on RTS**
    - **Multitasks**
        - Periodic tasks
        - Aperiodic tasks
    - **Schedulability**
        - The ability of tasks to meet all hard deadlines
    - **Performance**
        - Response time
        - Cost of missing deadline
    - What to do if not all deadlines can be met?
        - ?
    - Does a real-time system mean a *fast* system?
        - No, as long as the tasks execute when needed then it is a real-time system

**RTOS and Kernel Module**
- **Kernel and Kernel Space**
    - Kernel runs within the OS
    - Services provided by Kernels:
        - Process management
        - Memory management
        - File system
        - Scheduling
        - Interrupt Handling
        - Inter-process Communication and Networking
    - User Space is the space in memory where user processes run
    - Kernel space is the space in memory where kernel processes run
- User vs Kernel/Supervisor Modes

- How does the OS deliver the services to User Processes?
    - User processes request a service from Kernel by **making a system call**
    - The **library procedure** is used in a system call
        - This procedure puts aparams of the system call in suitable registers and then issues a **TRAP** instruction
        - The control is passed onto the Kernel, checking the validity of the params, and performing the requested service
        - When finished, a code is put in a register saying if the operation was carried out successfully or if it failed
        - A return from the **TRAP** instruction is then executed and the control is passed back to the user process
- User space and kernel space are located in different spaces
    - When a system call is executed, the arguments to the call are passed from the user space to the kernel space
    - **A user process becomes a kernel process when it executes a system call**

- **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**
    - Designed for real-time tasks, where correctness depends on logic of the result and time
    - Hard or Soft RTS depends on how to define cost on missing a deadline
    - Examples of commercial RTOS's: QNX, VxWorks, RTLinux, LynxOS, Windows CE, RTAI, etc.
- What makes an OS 'real time'?
    - Guarantee deadlines are met
    - Predictability
- **Process Scheduling**
    - OS must decide which processes to run first, which order, etc.
    - A good scheduling algorithm for non-real-time systems have the following objectives:
        1. **Fairness**: Make sure each process gets a fair share of the CPU
        2. **Efficiency**: Keep CPU busy to serve as much workload as possible
        3. **Response Time**: Minimize wait times of users
        4. **Throughput**: Maximize the number of tasks processed per hour
- **OS vs. RTOS**

- Is Linux an RTOS?
    - No, a kernel task may have exclusive access to some data for a long time, delaying an RT task
    - Linux provides a limited kernel-mode preemption to execute any task during system calls
        - Kernel programs can always **preempt (able to interrupt current task with higher priority tasks)** user-space programs
    - Linux recorders request from multiple processes and batch operations to use the hardware more efficiently

===
- Lab 1: Due Friday, September 18th
    - Next week will go through connecting to myRio devices
    - Documents are there to read before Lab 2 for connecting to myRio
- No lab this week, Lab 1 starts next Monday, September 14th
    - Safety quiz MUST be done before taking part in lab, will also be put up on Monday, September 14th, in the quizzes section of Avenue
