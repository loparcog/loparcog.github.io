Simulation Continued
===

Recall...
- Constructing a Simulation
    - A *discrete event simulation* has the following general structure. There are sets of *variables* and *events*. Generally, we have the following variables:
        1. Time variable (*t*) - The elapsed (simulated) time
        2. Counter variables - Track the number of times that certain events have occurred (by time *t*)
        3. State variables - "State" of the system at time *t*, the state should be chosen such that the next state can be uniquely determined given any event occurrence
        4. Output variables
    - Whenever an event occurs, value of variables updated
    - Must determine when next event occurs - keep an event list (may not be explicit) that lists the nearest future events and when they are scheduled to occur

Ex: Simulate two single-server queues in series (output of the first feeds the second)
1. Time between arrivals: $Exp(\lambda)$
2. Processing times of first server: $Exp(\mu_1)$
3. Processing times of second server: $Exp(\mu_2)$
4. FCFS processing at both servers
- SOLN: Three kinds of events:
    1. Arrival to system
    2. Departure from queue 1
    3. Departure from queue 2
- The events list in this case consists of the time of the next arrival, the next completion at queue 1, and the next completion at queue 2. (Equivalently, the time until the next occurrence of each of these events)
    - The state is the queue length at each server (including the job in service if there is one)
- Processing events - arrival
    - Update time, state, times to next events
    - Note arrival time (response time is output variable)
    - Generate new arrival time (new time to next arrival)
    - If queue 1 was empty, generate new processing time at queue 1
- Processing events - completion at queue 1
    - Update time, state, times to next events
    - If queue 1 is not empty, generate new server 1 processing time
    - If queue 2 was empty, generate new server 2 processing time
- Processing events - completion at queue 1
    - Update time, state, times to next events
    - Note departure time, calculate response time (now or at end)
    - If queue 2 not empty, generate new server 2 processing time
- Ran code `two_queue.m` to get resulting values
    - Know average response time should be 2.50, but we got 2.5187
    - How confident are we in this answer if we didn't know the answer?

Simulation Packages
- It would be nice if this were to some degree automated, like the Matlab example
    - Things are pretty straightforward, but requires quite a lot of bookkeeping
- Will go through more tomorrow

Confidence Intervals
- Suppose we have the following data points (samples): 23, 33, 14, 15, 42, etc.
- Average computed from these samples as 26.91 ($\bar{X}$)
- However, this is typically not good enough. We would like to know "how good" our estimate is, one way is to provide bounds such that:  
$$P(a \leq E[X] \leq b) = 1-a$$
    - This is where $E[X]$ is the true mean of the dataset
- Ex: Look at the following example points;  
10, 10, 10, 10, 10 -> $\bar{X} = 10$  
2, 17, 11, 13, 7 -> $\bar{X} = 10$  
    - Which one would you have more confidence in the actual value of a point in the system is 10?
    - Obviously the first one, average is not enough to give information about the dataset
        - Furthermore, the first dataset may have more data that would not be 10, which could cause issues for people assuming all the numbers in the set are 10
    - Main focus is how many points are in the dataset and how spread out they are
- Problem is, given a set of samples and *a*, calculate *a* and *b*
- $100(1-a)$ is the **confidence level**, here given as a percentage. We will typically look for 90% to 95%
- $a$ is the **significance level**, and $(a,b)$ is the **confidence interval**
- Find $t_{[1 - a/2 ; n-1]}$, the $1 - a/2$ quantile of the *t*-statistic with $n-1$ degrees of freedom
- For the data at the start, $n=33$, so we choose $1 - a = 0.90$ (90% CI)
- The CI is:  
$$(\bar{X} - \frac{t_{[1 - a/2 ; n-1]}s}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{X} + \frac{t_{[1 - a/2 ; n-1]}s}{\sqrt{n}})
- The value $s^2$ is the **sample variance**:  
$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_1 - \bar{X})^2$$
    - The smaller *s* is and the lager *n* is, the smaller the CI is, which is good
    - If you're not happy about the CI, you need to get more data, or reduce *a*
- For our data, $s=9.49$, giving us a CI of (24.11, 29.71)
