Distribution Cont

Ex: Calls come into a survey center, each call independent from one another. Calls come in at an average rate of 5 calls/hr. Let random variable X be the number of calls in a 3 hour period
- Q: Find $P(X=7)$ and $P(X \geq 1 )$  
SOLN:  
This problem has X as a poisson random variable, so we can use those functions to solve this:  
$P(X=7) = f_P(7) = \frac{e^{-\lambda T}(\lambda T)^x}{x!}$  
$(\lambda = 5, T = 3, x = 7)  
$= \frac{e^{-5 * 3}(* 5 * 3)^7}{7!}$  
$= 0.0104$  
Further, we can solve for $P(X \geq 1)$, but we will need a different equation setup, since X can be anything above 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, etc, it's a discrete value):  
$P(X \geq 1) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) + ...$  
Would take forever to calculate this, can use the definition:  
$= 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \frac{e^{-\lambda T}(\lambda T)^x}{x!}$  
$(\lambda = 5, T = 3, x = 0)  
$= \frac{e^{-5 * 3}(* 5 * 3)^0}{0!}$  
$= 0.9999...$  
Now for the variance,  
$\mu = \sigma^2 = \lambda T = 5 * 3 = 15$
