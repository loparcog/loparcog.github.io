Local Truncation Error
- Equation given as:  
    $$y_{i+1} = y_i + f(t_i, y_i)$$  
    $$d_i = \frac{y(t_{i+1}) - y(t_i)}h - f(t_i, y(t_i))$$  
    - Derived from Taylor series expansion
    - Note $y' = f(t, y), y(0) = y_0$
- **Will not be on exam**

Local Error
- Suppose $y(t)$ is the true solution
- At that point we compute $y_i$, giving us:  
    $$e_i = y(t_i) - y_i$$
    - What is the local error?
        - Difference between what we compute and error from original point
- Use **Van der Pol** to minimize (?) use non-uniform steps to replicate function
