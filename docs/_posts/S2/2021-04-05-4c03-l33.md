Authenticity and Authentication
===

Hash Function Algorithms
- MD5 hash function widely used (RFC 1321)
    - Computes 128-bit message digest in 4-step process
    - In 1996 a flaw was found in the design, should not be considered secure anymore
- SHA-2, SHA-3
    - 224, 256, 384, or 512 bits in digests

Certification for Public Key
- Symmetric key problem
    - How do two entities establish a shared secret key over a network?
    - SOLN: Trusted key distribution center (KDC) acting as intermediary between entities
        - DH
- Public key problem
    - When Alice obtains Bob's public key (from web site, email, diskette), how does she know it is Bob's public key and not Trudy's?
    - SOLN: Trusted certification authority (CA)

Certification Authorities
- Certification authority (CA) binds public keys to particular entities, *E*
- *E* (person, server) registers its public key with CA
    - *E* provides "proof of identity" to CA
    - CA creates certificate binding *E* to its public key
    - Certificate containing *E*'s public key digitally signed by CA - CA says "this is *E*'s public key"

- When Alice wants Bob's public key...
    - Gets Bob's certificate (from Bob or elsewhere)
    - Apply CA's public key to Bob's certificate, get Bob's public key

What have we learned so far?
- Message **confidentiality**: shared key or public key crypto
- Message **integrity**: hash
- **Authenticity** of a digital message: digital signature
- What about authenticity of a sender/receiver?
    - ARP poisoning
    - IP/MAC address spoofing
    - Phishing attacks
- Need **authentication**

Authentication
- **Goal:** Bob wants Alice to "prove" her identity to him
- **Protocol:** Assume pre-shared secret exists between Alice and Bob
    - Alice can send a message to Bob containing her IP address and something to say "I'm Alice", along with an encrypted password containing the pre-shared secret
    - **PROBLEM:** Trudy can do a "replay attack", resending the same message and pretend to be Alice
    - **This approach does not work**, and is complex since it requires both pre-shared secret and encryption between two parties

Authentication using Symmetric Key Crypto
- **Goal:** Avoid IP spoofing, playback attack
- **Nonce:** Number *R* used only *once-in-a-lifetime*
- **ap:** To prove Alice "live", Bob sends Alice nonce, *R*. Alice must return *R*, encrypted with shared secret key

    - **Problem:** Does not prevent Trudy from intercepting communication, also requires shared encryption key already

Authentication using Public Key Crypto
- Can we authenticate using public key techniques?
    - Use nonce, public key cryptography

Security Protocols
===

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- Transport layer security to any TCP-based application using SSL services
- Used between web browsers, servers for e-commerce (https)
    - SSL can be used for non-web applications as well, eg. IMAP
- SSL: Basis of IETFTransport Layer Security (TLS)
- Most commonly used today
- Security services:
    - Server authentication
        - SSL-enabled browser includes public key for trusted CA's
        - AAA (finish)
    - Data encryption
    - Data integrity
    - (Optional) client authentication
- Encrypted SSL session
    - Browser generates *symmetric session key*, encrypts it with server's public key, sends encrypted key to server
    - Using private key, server decrypts session key
    - Browser, server know session key
        - All data sent into TCP socket (by client or server) encrypted with session key
    - Client authentication can be done with client certificates
- SSL + RSA

- SSL Cipher Suite
