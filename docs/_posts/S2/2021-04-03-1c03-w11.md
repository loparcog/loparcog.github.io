Module 19: Ecosystems
===

Components of Ecosystems
- An **ecosystem** is a community of different species interacting with one another and their environment, to perpetuate or sustain their grouping
    - ie. A meadow in a forest, microbes colonizing the gut of a termite (micro-ecosystems)
- A **Ecotone** is a transitional region between different ecosystems
    - Shares many species and characteristics of both ecosystems, but may also have unique conditions
    - Often characterized by greater biodiversity
- Two types of components in a given area/ecosystem:
    1. Living organisms and their products are the biotic/organic component
    2. Nonliving components such as air, water, and rocks are the abiotic/inorganic component
- Ecosystems composed of different types of organisms
    - **Producers** convert sunlight to energy via photosynthesis and transform CO2 into organic carbon while releasing oxygen as a byproduct
        - **Autotrophs**, meaning self-feeding organisms
        - ie. Green plants
    - Energy may be found in inorganic compounds too, like various forms of iron and chemical transformation of compounds
    - **Consumers** are **heterotrophs**, they cannot transform CO2 into organic carbon, so must get carbon from other sources
        - Primary consumers are herbivores and feed on producers
        - Secondary are carnivores that feed on herbivores
        - May also be tertiary consumers in an ecosystem which feed on secondary consumers
        - Omnivores feed on everything
    - **Detritus Feeders and Decomposers** break down dead organic matter to its fundamental building blocks
        - Encompass wide range of insects, bacteria, protozoa and fungi

Ecosystems and Energy Transfer
- A **biomass pyramid** considers the total mass of all members of an ecosystem, producers and consumers
    - Higher levels have lower efficiency of energy conservation
    - Each level called a **trophic level**, encompasses all those organisms in a food web that are the same number of feeding levels away from the original source of energy
- A **food chain** represents a single feeding relationship starting from the original source of energy to the highest trophic level and ultimately to the decomposition of organic matter
    - Heat lost in each conversion
    - Typically only shows one species at each level
    - A more realistic model would be a **food web**, a network of feeding relationships
- What makes up an ecosystem?
    - Interactions between the different spheres, within the living organisms, or the biosphere, at the center of the exchanges
    - Also elements which are the building blocks of matter, key elements in all living organisms are nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur
        - Found in air, water, rocks, and soil
        - These elements are also called **nutrients**
    - Another component is energy, which is the ability to move matter
        - Any movement or transformation requires a change in energy, always being released or absorbed
- According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy is neither created nor destroyed
    - Similar to water pumped into a tank, it is transformed from low to high potential
    - Formation of organic material from inorganic material leads to a gain in potential energy through the construction of complex molecules from simple ones
    - Decay involves the loss of energy as it is released during the decompositions process, where complex molecules are broken
- Second law; any energy conversion leads to less usable energy than initially
    - Disorganization of energy called **entropy**
- Concept of trophic level efficiency is an application of the second law in ecosystems
    - Trophic level efficiency is the ratio of the production of one trophic level to the production of the next lower level
    - Value never very high; of the energy received from the Sun during the year, green plants convert only 1-3% to new plant tissue
    - **Net primary production** represents the amount of potential energy available to the trophic level above
- As a herbivore ingests plant tissue with high energy potential, only a fraction will be assimilated as bodily tissue, and therefore as high potential energy once again
    - Most energy either lost or consumed to maintain vital functions
    - This transfer occurs at every trophic level
    - Gradually, only a fraction of the potential energy initially available in the form to bio mass from produces will have been transferred to the highest layer

Biodiversity
- **Biodiversity** is the sum total of all organisms in an area
    - Takes into account diversity of species, genes, populations and communities
    - Different indicators of biodiversity can be used, for example, species richness
- Species are structural components of ecosystems
    - The dominant species tend to regulate major ecosystem processes such as energy flow and nutrient cycling
    - Keystone species have a strong or wide reaching impact, far out of proportion to thair abundance (eg. beavers)
    - Keystone species like wolves may also maintain the population size of other species
- Biodiversity helps to maintain ecosystem functions
    - Contributes to the purification of air and water, detoxify and decompose waste, recycle nutrients and renew soils
- Biodiversity contributes to the stabilization and moderation of Earth's climate
    - Also facilitates pollination of plants and maintains the adaptability of genetic resources

Module 20: Water Pollution
===

Water Pollutants
- **Main water pollutants** include pathogens such as...
    - E. coli
    - Organic wastes
    - Gas and oil
    - Sewage
    - Chemical pollutants, including pesticides like DDT
    - Sediments 
    - Nutrients, such as nitrates and phosphorus
    - Heavy metals, some radioactive (lead, zinc, cadmium, etc.)
    - Heat, impacting endojanice populations of fish
- If water discharged into the receiving environment is too hot, it limits oxygen availability
    - However, if too cold, populations may not be adapted to such temperatures
- Pollutants may be introduced from point or nonpoint sources
    - Point sources is a specific spot where large quantities of pollutants are discharged
    - Nonpoint sources are a diffuse source of pollutants, often consisting of small point sources distributed over a wide area
- Groundwater can be polluted by defective onsite septic systems, leaky tanks or petroleum pipelines, and industrial chemical leaks or spills
    - Can also come from seepage from municipal landfills, fertilizers dispersed on agricultural land, pesticides, and contaminants in wet and dry atmospheric fallout
- Pollutants can be **non-persisting**, meaning they can be broken down by chemical reactions or by bacteria into simple substances
    - Damage they cause is reversible
    - Domestic sewage and fertilizers fall in this, but can lead to eutrophication if pollution load is too high
- **Persistent** pollutants are substances that degrade very slowly or cannot be broken down at all
    - May remain in the aquatic environment for many years, and damage caused is irreversible or only over a long span of decades/centuries
    - Pesticides like DDT, petroleum compounds, dioxins, or polyarmoatic hydrocarbons (PH) such as anthracene fall in this category
- Multiple **pathogens** can also pollute water
    - Ex; salmonella bacteria, causing salmonellosis and typhoid fever
    - Also bacteria causing cholera, e. coli
    - Parasites like the cryptosporidium parvum and giardia
    - Viruses like the hepatitis A virus, or roundworm nematoads

Monitoring Water Pollution
- **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**: A measure of the amount of oxygen consumed by microbes as they break down organic matter within water samples
    - Routinely measured as part of water quality testing
    - Dead organic matter added to water bodies naturally or through agricultural runoff or urban sewage
    - In general, urban areas also increase the BOD in streams
- All streams have some capability to degrade organic waste, but it varies from one stream to another
    - Capability called **assimilative capacity**
    - Problems come when a stream is overloaded with biochemical oxygen demanding waste
    - This exceeds stream capacity, overpowering the streams natural cleansing function
- When BOD is high, the dissolved oxygen, or DO content of the water, becomes too low to support life
    - This is wen the DO is **les than 5 mg/L**
    - Under these circumstances, an alert may be issued
- Sediments also contribute to pollution
    - Sediments are rock mineral fragments from gravel particles greater than 2mm in diameter to finer sand, silt, clay, and finer particles
    - By volume and mass, sediments are the greatest water pollutants, representing a two fold problem:
        1. Indicative of erosion, depleting soil 
        2. Reduce quality of water resource
    - Can be released through construction
- Strategies to deal with pollution involves... 
    - Identifying the material(s) causing the pollution
    - Identifying the source(s) and/or parties responsible
    - Developing and implementing strategies to prevent pollutants from entering the environment
    - Developing and implementing alternate means to meet societal needs
