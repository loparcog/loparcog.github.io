Routing Protocols and Autonomous Systems
===

Dijkstra Discussion
- Algorithm complexity: *n* nodes
    - Each iteration: need to check all nodes, *w*, not in *N*
    - $n(n+1)/2$ comparisons: $O(n^2)$
    - More efficient implementations possible: $O(n\log n)$
- Oscillations possible if dynamic link costs are used
    - eg. Support link cost equals amount of carried traffic

Bellman-Ford
- Defined as the following:
    - $d_x (y)$: Cost of the least-cost path from *x* to *y*
    - We get the equation:  
        $$d_x(y) = \min_{v \in N} (c(x,v) + d_v(y))$$
        - $\min$: Taken over all neighbors *v* of *x* (including *x* itself)
        - $c(x,v)$: Cost to neighbour *v*
        - $d_v(y)$: Cost from neighbour *v* to destination *y*

Distance Vector Routing
- **Distance Vector**: A node's least-known costs to other nodes
- Each node periodically *sends* its own distance vector estimate to neighbours **only** when its DV changes
- When *x* receives a new DV estimate from a neighbour, it updates its own DV using the Bellman equation (for each node $y \in N$):  
    $$D_x(y) \leftarrow \min ((c(x, v) + d_v(y))$$
- Each router maintains a **table**
    - Best known distance from itself and its neighbours to all routers
- Each local iteration caused by:
    - Local link cost change
    - Message from neighbour
- Notify neighbours **only** when its DV changes
    - Neighbours then notify their neighbours if necessary
- Example in slides

Routing Protocol in the Internet
- **Internet Routing Protocols**: Responsible for constructing and updating the forwarding tables at routers
- **Scale**: With up to 4 billion destinations...
    - Can't store all destination addresses in forwarding tables!
    - Forwarding table exchange would swamp links!
- **Administrative Autonomy**: Internet is equal to number of networks
    - Each network admin may want to control routing in its own network

Hierarchical Routing
- **Autonomous systems (AS)**: Region of a network under a single administrative entity
    - Holds multiple links/routers
- Internet routing works at two levels
- Each AS runs in an **intra-domain** routing protocol that establishes routes within its domain
    - AS: Region of networks under a single administrative entity
    - Link state (eg. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF))
    - Distance vector (eg. Routing Information Protocol (RIP))
- AS's participate in an **inter-domain** routing protocol that establishes routes between domains
    - Path vector (eg. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP))

Interconnected AS's
- Forwarding table is configured by **both intra- and inter-AS routing algorithm**
    - Intra-AS sets entries for **internal dests** (in the same AS)
    - Inter-AS and Intra-AS sets entries for **external dests**
- Inter-AS Tasks

- Ex: Setting forwarding table in router 1d
    1. Suppose AS1 learns from the inter-AS protocol that subnet *x* is reachable from AS3 (gateway 1c) but not from AS2
    2. Inter-AS protocol propagates reachability info to all internal routers
    3. Router 1d determines from intra-AS routing that its interface *I* is on the least cost path to 1c
    4. Puts in forwarding table entry `(x,I)`
