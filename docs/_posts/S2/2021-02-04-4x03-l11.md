Interpolation Continued
===

NOTE: Goes over Q5 in lecture
- Rule of thumb, if `cond(A)` $\approx 10^K$, then ~K digits are lost

Interpolation
- Say we have a set of data $[(x_i, y_i)]_{i=0}^n$
- We can get a function out of this with the following:  
    $$V(x) = \sum_{j=0}^n c_j \gamma_j (x)$$  
    Where $c$ is a constant and $\gamma$ is a function, such that $\gamma_j = x^{j-1}$
- We can then get a system for **Lagrange Interpolation**, given as:
    $$L_j (x_i) = 0 \text{ if } i \neq j, 1 \text{ if } i \eq j
- This then expands into a full equation:
    $$L_j(x) = \frac{(x-x_0)(x-x_1)...(x-x_{j-1})(x-x_{j+1})...(x-x_n)}{(x_j-x_0)(x_j-x_1)...(x_j-x_{j-1})(x_j-x_{j+1})...(x_j-x_n)}
