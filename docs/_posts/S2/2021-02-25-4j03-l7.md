Reliable Transmission
===

Internet Protocols
- Deals with the **data link layer**, but that is just for a link, the **transport** layer can also deal with reliable transmission from end-to-end

Reliable Transmission
- Suppose error detection identifies valid and invalid frames
    - Due to noise on channels, errors are inevitable
- Can we make the channel appear *reliable*? Three things:
    - Insure packet delivery (packet is transmitted and guarantee the client will receive the packet correctly)
    - Maintain packet order (packet that is delivered first should be received first)
    - Provide reliability at full link capacity (don't sacrifice throughput/efficiency for reliability)
- Examples of unreliable transmission
    1. Alice transmits 6 frames, but the receiver, Bob, only receives two frames due to the noise, many frames are dropped

    2. Alice transmits 6 frames, but Bob receives the frames out of order

- Reliable transmission outline
    - Fundamentals of **Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)** algorithms
        - A family of algorithms that provide reliability through retransmission
    - ARQ algorithms with concept of **sliding window**
        - Stop-and-wait
        - Go-back-n
        - Selective repeat

Terminology
- **Acknowledgement (ACK)**: Receiver tells the sender when a frame is received
    - Selective acknowledgement (**SACK**): Specifies a set of frames received
    - Cumulative acknowledgement (**ACK**): Have received specified frame and all previous
    - Negative acknowledgement (**NAK**): Received frames with error detected
    - Ex. If frames 0-4, 6, and 7 have been received by the receiver, what are the values of SACK, ACK, and NAK?
        - SACK: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
        ACK: [4]
        NAK:  [5]
- **Timeout (TO)**: Sender detects the frame (or ACK) was lost, sender can try again to receive ACK within timeout period
- ARQ also called **Positive Acknowledgement with Retransmission (PAR)**

Stop-and-Wait
- Basic idea:
    1. Send a frame
    2. Wait for ACK or TO
    3. If TO, go to 1
    4. If ACK, get new frame and go to 1
- Some images of scenarios are seen below
    - Success  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/acks.PNG) 
    - Lost frame  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/acklf.PNG) 
    - Lost ACK
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/acklack.PNG) 
    - Delayed frame (transmission time of frame and ACK (RTT) is larger than timeout, so sender retransmits frame before receiving ACK, making sender send frame multiple times and receiver receive a frame multiple times, but only keeping one copy and discarding others)  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ackdf.PNG) 
- When timeout occurs, the sender cannot tell whether the frame or ACK got lost
    - How to guarantee at-most-once delivery?
- We need:
    - 1-bit sequence numbers
        - Sender tracks frame ID to send
        - Receiver tracks next frame ID to expect
- We have now achieved frames delivered reliably and in order
    - Is that enough?
- Problem: Only allows one outstanding frame
    - Does not keep the pipe full
    - Eg. 100ms RTT, one frame per RTT = 1KB, achievable bandwidth is 80 KBPS regardless of link bandwidth!
- Full utilization of the link capacity would need to send multiple outstanding frames to fill the pipeline

Sliding Window
- Consider an ordered stream of data frames
- Stop-and-Wait
    - Window of one frame
    - Slides along stream over time
- Multiple frame send window
    - Window watches over outstanding frames
- Multiple frame receive window
    - Window watches over expected frames
- Send Window
    - Fixed length
    - Starts at earliest unacknowledged frame
    - Only frames in window are active  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/sw.PNG) 
- Receive Window
    - Fixed length (unrelated to send window)
    - Starts at earliest frame not received
    - Only frames in window accepted

- Sliding Window Terminology
    - Sender Parameters
        - Send Window Size (**SWS**)
        - Last Acknowledgement Received (**LAR**)
        - Last Frame Sent (**LFS**)

    - Received Parameters
        - Receive Window Size (**RWS**)
        - Next Frame Expected (**NFE**)
        - Last Frame Acceptable (**LFA**)

- Sliding Window Details
    - Sender tasks
        - Assign sequence numbers
        - On ACK arrival;
            - Advance LAR
            - Slide window
    - Receiver tasks (on frame arrival (N));
        - Silently discard if outside window (N < NFE or N >= NFE + RWS)
        - Send cumulative ACK if within window
    - Sequence number space
        - Finite number, so wrap around
        - Need space larger than SWS (outstanding frames)
            - Need it twice as large to allow sliding window algs to work properly
            - Number of sequence numbers being equal to SWS is NOT appropriate
    - Example of incorrect behaviour
        - 3-bit sequence number (0-7)
        - RWS = SWS = 8
        - Sender transmits 0-7
        - All arrive, but ACK's lost
        - Sender retransmits
        - Receiver accepts as new data sequence
    - Window Sizes
        - Selecting SWS, compute from:  
        $$\frac{Bandwidth * Delay}{Frame \text{ } Size}$$
        - Selecting RWS, depends on buffer capacity of receiver

ARQ Algorithm Classification
- Three types:
    - Stop-and-Wait: SWS = 1, RWS = 1
    - Go-Back-N: SWS = N, RWS = 1
        - Receiver only buffers one frame
        - If a frame is lost, the sender may need to retransmit up to *N* frames (ie. sender "goes back" *N* frames)
    - Selective Repeat: SWS = N, RWS = M
        - Receiver buffers M frames (usually M = N)
        - If a frame/ACK is lost, sender must only resend frames lost within the send window
        - Variations
            - How long is the frame timeout?
            - Does protocol adapt timeouts?
            - Use cumulative or per-frame ACK?
            - Does protocol adapt SWS and/or RWS?
- Roles of a Sliding Window Protocol
    - Reliable delivery on an unreliable link (core function)
    - Preserve delivery order (controlled by the receiver)
    - Channel utilization (sender transmits at achievable capacity)

Ex: Show why the sequence number should be twice as large as SWS
- Consider the sliding window algorithm with SWS = RWS = 8, and the sequence number space contains 15 numbers (0, 1, 2, ..., 14)
    - Receiver retransmitting first frame would be in the end of the next expected set of frames, unknown if it is a retransmission or a new frame altogether
    - Say that frames 0 to 7 are received by the receiver, but all ACKs are lost
        - The sender then retransmits frames 0 to 7
        - Receiver is expecting frame 8 to 15, but frame 15 has sequence ID 0, so the receiver is confused

Number of SeqNum Cannot Grow Infinitely Large
- In practice, a frame's sequence number is specified in a header field of a finite size
    - Eg. 3-bit filed means that there are 8 possible sequence numbers (0-7)
    - It is necessary to reuse the sequence number (sequence numbers wrap around)
- Q: If SWS and RWS are given, what is the relation of SWS, RWS, and the number of available sequence numbers?
    - Case 1: Go-Back-N algorithm, SWS = N, RWS = 1
    There should be at least **N + 1** sequence numbers
    - Case 2: SWS = RWS = N  
    There should be at least **2N** sequence numbers
    - Case 3: SWS = N, RWS > SWS  
    There should be at least **2N** sequence numbers
    - Choosing sequence number as **2 * SWS** is safe!

Ex: Minimum Number of Bits for Sequence Numbers
- Suppose you are designing a sliding window protocol for a **1 Mbps** point-to-point link to the moon which has a **one-way latency of 1.25s**. Assuming each frame carries **1KB** of daya, what is the minimum number of bits you need for the sequence number?
- SOLN:  
RTT = 2.5s  
Bandwidth * Delay = 2.5Mb  
Number of frames transmitted before ACK is received:  
$$(2.5*10^6) / (8.2^10) = 305.18$$  
- The window size should be this large, the sequence number space must cover twice this range, or up to 610, hence **10 bits are needed**
