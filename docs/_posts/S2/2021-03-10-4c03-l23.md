Intra-AS Routing: IGP
- **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)**: Intra-domain routing protocol
    - Provide internal reachability

Most Common Intra-AS Routing Protocols
- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/rip.PNG)
    - Distance vector algorithm
    - Included in BSD-UNIX distribution in 1982
    - Distance metric: $ of hops (max of 15 hops)
    - Advertisements
        - Distance vectors: Exchanged among neighbors every 30s vis Response Message (also called an **advertisement**)
        - Each advertisement is a list of up to 25 destination networks within an AS
    - Link Failure and Recovery: If no advertisements after 180s, neighbour/link declared dead
        - Routes via neighbour invalidated
        - New advertisements sent to neighbours
        - Neighbours in turn send out new advertisements (if tables changed)
        - Link failure info quickly propagates to entire net
    - Table Processing: RIP routing tabled managed by **application protocol** AAA
- **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**
    - "Open": Publicly available
    - Uses **link state algorithm**
        - LS dissemination
        - Topology map at each node
        - Route computation using Dijkstra's algorithm
    - OSPF advertisement carries one entry per neighbour router
    - Advertisements disseminated to entire AS (via **flooding**)
        - Carried in OSPF messages directly **over IP** (rather than TCP/UDP)
    - "Advanced" features (not in RIP)
        - **Security**: All OSPF messages authenticated (to prevent malicious intrusion)
        - **Multiple** same-cost paths allowed (only one path in RIP)
        - For each link, multiple cost metrics for different **TOS** (eg. satellite link cost set "low for best effort, high for real time)
        - Integrated uni and **multicast** support: Multicast OSPF (MOSPF) uses same topology data base as OSPF
        - **Hierarchical** OSPF in large domains
- AAA (another method)

Inter-Domain Routing Protocol
- Forwarding table is configured by **both intra- and inter-AS routing algorithm**
    - Intra-AS sets entries for **internal dests**
    - Inter-AS and Intra-AS sets entries for **external dests**
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): Uses **AS path vector**
    - eBGP between gateway routers
    - iBGP between routers in the same AS
    - Policy-driven
- Example in slides
