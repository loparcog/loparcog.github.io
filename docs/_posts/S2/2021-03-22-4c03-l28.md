WLAN 802.11 Cont.
===

IEEE 802.11: Multiple Access
- Like Ethernet, uses CSMA:
    - Random access
    - Carrier sense: Don't collide with ongoing transmission
- Unlike Ethernet:
    - **No collision detection** - transmit all frames to completion
    - **With acknowledgement** - because without collision detection, you don't know if your transmission collided or not
- Why no collision detection?
    - Difficult to receive (sense collisions) when transmitting due to weak received signals (fading)
    - Can't sense all collisions in any case: hidden terminal
- Goal: avoid collisions -- **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**

Hidden Terminal Problem
- Two hosts *A* and *C* trying to talk to *B*, but they cannot see each other
    - Collision can occur since they cannot hear eachother

Medium Access Control Logic
- 802.11 Sender
    - 1: For a new frame, if sense channel idle for DIFS then transmit entire frame (no CD, DIFS is a short amount of time)
    - 2: For a retransmitted frame or if sense channel is busy then...
        - Start random backoff time
        - If sense channel idle for DIFS then timer counts down while channel idle, transmit when timer expires
    - If no ACK for transmission, increase random backoff interval, repeat 2
- 802.11 Receiver
    - If frame received OK, return ACK after SIFS (ACK needed due to hidden terminal problem)

Interframe Space (IFS)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ifs.PNG)
- Short IFS (SIFS)
    - Shortest IFS (used for ACK, CTS, poll response)
    - Used for immediate response actions
- Point coordination function IFS (PIFS)
    - Midlength IFS
    - Used by centralized controller in PCF scheme when using polls
- Distributed coordination function IFS (DIFS)
    - Longest IFS (data, RTS)
    - Used as minimum delay of async frames contending for access
- Extended Interframe space (EIFS)
    - Used when received frame containing errors
- **SIDS < PIFS < DIFS < EIFS**

More on Medium Access Control Logic
- Contention window (in slots)
    - Each station maintains a contention window (CW) set to $CW_{min}$ initially
    - Upon collision, $CW' = (CW + 1)* 2 - 1$ (*exponentially backoff*) till it reaches $CW_{max}$
    - CW is reset to $CW_{min}$ upon successful delivery

Example
- A pair of nodes *A* and *B* are sending packets to *C*
- Back-off intervals: Node *A*: 2, 3 and *B* are 2,4
- Both nodes count down at $t_0$
- Size of the backoff-window in slow before send data?
- Which node sends data?
- Size of the interframe space before *A*, *B* countdown?
- Size of the backoff-window in slow before sends data?
    - AAA (get ans)
