Ethernet and CSMA
===

IEEE 802 Protocol Suite
- A family of IEEE standards for body, personal, local area networks and metropolitan area networks
- Specifies **data link and physical layer**
    - 802.2 logical link control (LLC)
    - 802.3 Ethernet
    - 802.11 Wireless local area networks (WLAN)
    - 802.15 Wireless personal area networks (WPAN) (eg. bluetooth)

Ethernet
- "Dominant" wired LAN technology
    - Cheap (~\$20 for 1Gbps cards, ~\$100 for 10Gbps cards)
    - First widely used LAN technologies
- Kept up with speed race, going from 10 Mbps - 400 Gbps

Bus vs Star Topology
- Bus topology popular through mid 90s

- Now star topology prevails
- Connections choices of hub or switch (switch more common now)

Hubs vs Switches
- Both connect segments of LANs
- Hubs are *layer-1* devices that duplicate the messages to other ports
    - Computers connected by hubs are in **the same connection domain**
- Switches are *layer-2* devices that forward the messages to the selected port
    - Computers connected by switches are in **the same broadcast domain**
    - Point-to-point link between a computer and a switch
- Hub given on top, switch on the bottom

Ethernet Frame Structure
- Sending adapter encapsulates IP datagram (or other network layer protocol packet) in Ethernet frame
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ef.PNG)
- **Preamble**: 7 bytes with pattern 10101010 followed by 1 bytes with pattern 10101011
    - Used to synchronize receiver and sender clock rates
- **Address**: 6 bytes, frames are received by all adapters on a LAN and dropped if address does not match
- **Type**: 2 bytes, indicates the types of the Ethernet frame (eg. Ethernet II, 802.2 LLC frame, ...)
- **CRC**: 4 bytes, checked at receiver, if error is detected, the frame is dropped
- **Data Payload**: Max 1500 bytes, minimum 46 bytes
    - If data is less than 46 bytes, pad with zeros to reach 46 bytes
    - "Jumbo frame" introduced later to lower overhead from header, holds up to 9000 bytes for 1G/10G/100G)

Unreliable, Connectionless Service
- **Connectionless**: No handshaking between sending and receiving adapter
- **Unreliable**: Receiving adapter doesn't send ACKs or NACKs to sending adapter
    - Stream of datagrams passed to network layer can have gaps
    - Gaps will be filled if app is using TCP
    - Otherwise, app will see the gaps

Medium Access Control in Ethernet
- Shared medium with bus or star topology with hubs
    - Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
    - Half-duplex: nodes take turns in transmissions
- Point-to-point in star topology with switches
    - Full duplex: Can send and receive at the same time
    - How to learn which port a device is connected?

CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)
- CSMA: Listen before transmit
    - If channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame
    - If channel sensed busy: defer transmission
- Don't interrupt others!
- Does this eliminate all collisions?
    - **No**, CSMA just **reduces** collision
- Flow chart for a packet sending
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/fc.PNG)
- Collision detection example
    - *B* and *D* can't tell that collision occurred
    - **Jamming Signal**: Inform all other stations they shouldn't transmit
