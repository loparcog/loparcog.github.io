Internet Continued

Traceroute
- Who is McMaster's ISP?
    - Looking through the traceroute result, we can work out that Orion and Cogent are both internet providers, as well as fibre wired "outside" services
- Situations like packet loss may occur when return times are printed as `* *`
    - Why does packet loss occur?
    - Why are there variable delays and what are the factors that contribute to this?
        - What can we do about them?

Packet-Switching: Store-And-Forward
- Application message is broken down into **packets**, typically ~1000 bytes each
- **Store and Forward**: The entire packet **must** arrive at a router before it can be transmitted to the next link
    - Forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination
- Individual packets can be forwarded along **different network paths**, so all packets don't need to go down the same route
- How do loss and delay occur?
    - Packets stored in router buffers
    - Packet arrival rate to link exceeds output link capacity
        - Packets queue, wait for their turn, causing delay
        - Delay can also be caused through transmission (travel time), packet processing (deciding route), and propagation delay (distance and max speed)
    - Loss can occur if no free buffers are available in the router, causing any new packet(s) to be dropped
- So overall, we have four sources of packet delay:
    1. **Processing Delay (Computational)**: Check bit errors, determine output link, deep packet inspection ($\mu s$)
    2. **Queueing Delay**: Time waiting at output link for transmission, depends on congestion level of router (ms)
        - Let *R* = link bandwidth (bps), *L* = packet length (bits), and *a* = average packet arrival rate (packet/s)
        - The **traffic intensity** is given as:  
            $$\text{Traffic Intensity} = \frac{L * a}{R}$$
        - $TI \approx 0$: Average queueing delay **small**
        - $TI \approx 1$: Delay becomes **large**
        - $TI \gt 1$: More "work" arriving than can be services, average delay **infinite**
            - True if the buffer is infinitely large, but we experience packet loss instead
    3. **Transmission Delay (Outgoing)**: Where *R* is the link bandwidth (bps) and *L* is the packet length (bits), the time to send bits into the link is calculated by $L/R$
    4. **Propagation Delay**: Where *d* is the length of the physical link and *s* is the propagation speed in the medium (assume light speed $3*10^8$ m/sec), the propagation delay is calculated by $d/s$
        - NOTE: *s* and *R* are **very** different values
        - Difference can be seen [at this helpful animation](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/ecs_kurose_compnetwork_7/cw/content/interactiveanimations/transmission-vs-propogation-delay/transmission-propagation-delay-ch1/index.html)
- **Nodal Delay**: Total delay of a internet system:
    $$d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}$$
- $d_{proc}$: Processing delay (typically a few microseconds or less)
- $d_{queue}$: Queueing delay (depends on the level of network loads)
- $d_{trans}$: Transmission delay (L/R, significant for low-speed links)
- $d_{prop}$: Propagation delay (a few microseconds to hundreds of msecs)
