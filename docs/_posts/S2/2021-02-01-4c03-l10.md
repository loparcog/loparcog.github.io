Transport Services and Protocol
- Provide **logical communication** between app **processes** running on different hosts
- Transport protocols run in end systems
    - Sender side: Breaks app messages into **segments**, passes to network layer
    - Receiver side: Reassembles segments into messages, passes to app layer
- More than one transport protocol available to apps
    - Internet: TCP and UDP

- Transport vs Network Layer
    - **Network Layer**: Logical communication between hosts
    - **Transport Layer**: Logical communication between processes
        - AAA

Internet transport-layer protocols
- Reliable, in-order delivery (TCP)
    - Congestion control
    - Flow control
    - Connection setup
- Unreliable, unordered delivery (UDP)
    - No-frills extension of "best-effort" IP
- Services not available to both methods:
    - Delay guarantees
    - Bandwidth guarantees

Multiplexing/Demultiplexing
- Multiplexing at sender host
    - Gather data from multiple sockets, enveloping data with header (later used for demultiplexing)
- Demultiplexing at receiver host
    - Delivering received segments to correct sockets
- Image example:
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/mdm.PNG)
- How demultiplexing works
    - Host receives IP datagrams
        - Each datagram has a source IP address and destination IP address
        - Each datagram carries 1 transport-layer segment
        - Each segment has source, destination port number
    - Host uses **IP addresses and port numbers** to direct segment to appropriate socket
        - TCP sockets are identified by `(S-IP, D-IP, SP, DP)` 4-tuple
        - UDP sockets are identified by `(D-IP, DP)` 2-tuple

Principles of Reliable Data Transfer Protocols
- Important in applications, transport layer and link layers
- Mechanisms:
    - **Error detection and correction**: A packet is received but may be erroneous
    - **Loss detection and recovery**: A packet is missing
- Design issues:
    - Where to put the functionality?
    - Efficiency; utilization of bandwidth resource (ie. sending a message 1000 times will ensure message is properly sent, but is highly inefficient)  
        **Utilization = (Maximum application data rate)/(Available bandwidth)**
        - We would like to see 100% utilization, but due to overhead and such, utilization will be much lower than 100%
- Error Detection
    - Problem: Detect bit errors in packets (frames)
    - Solution: Add extra bits to each packet
    - Techniques (different use case for each):
        - Parity check
        - Checksum
        - Other sophisticated coding schemes such as Reed-Solomon code
