TCP Cont. 2
===

TCP Reliable Data Transfer
- **Retransmissions triggered by duplicate acks**
    - Sending the same ACK if a sequence jump occurs, indicating that the ACK'd sequence has been lost

- Retransmission timeout issues
    - If the sender hasn't received an ACK by timeout, retransmit the first packet in the window, restart timer
    - How do we pick a timeout value?
    - Example of issues:

- AAA (fill)
- How do we estimate RTT?
    - **SampleRTT**: Measured time from segment transmission until ACK receipt
        - Ignore retransmissions since we cannot be sure that the ACK was from the first or second transmission
        - Causes a lot of fluctuation in RTT measuring in comparison to estimated value
    - **Estimated RTT**: Exponential weighted moving average, calculated as:  
        $$(1-\alpha)*\text{EstimatedRTT} + \alpha * \text{SampleRTT}$$
        - Influence of past sample decreases exponentially fast, more data evens it all out
        - Typical value of $\alpha = 0.125$, since we want historical data to weigh more than new data
- So, to set the timeout value...
    - Use the EstimatedRTT plus a "safety margin"
        - Large variation in EstimatedRTT means larger safety margin
    - First estimate of how much SampleRTT deviates from EstimatedRTT:  
        $$DevRTT = (1 - \beta) * \text{DevRTT} + \beta * | \text{SampleRTT} - \text{EstimatedRTT}|$$
        - Typically, $\beta = 0.25$
    - Then set the timeout interval to:  
        $$\text{TimeoutInterval} = \text{EstimatedRTT} + 4*\text{DevRTT}$$
        - Kind of like mean plus 4 times standard deviation, can calculate probability RTT is in the range

TCP Congestion Control 
- Congestion Detection
    - Loss event: timeout or 3 duplicate acks
    - TCP sender reduces rate (congestion window) after loss event
- Rate adjustment (Probing)
    - Slow start
    - Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)
        - Looks like a saw wave of increasing and decreasing, never flatlining
        - Always adapting to behaviors
    - Conservative after timeout events
    - Utilizes packet loss events as evidence for congestion
- Does packet loss equal congestion?
