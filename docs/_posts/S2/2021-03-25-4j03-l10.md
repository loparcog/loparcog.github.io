End-to-End Protocols
===

End-to-End Service Model
- Also known as Process-to-Process, implementing the transport layer
- Support services needed by the application
    - Multiple connections per host
    - Messages delivered in the order they were sent
    - Messages delivered at most once
        - These two are known as **reliable transmission**
    - Synchronization between sender and receiver
    - No limit on message size
    - Flow control

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Service model
    - Thin veneer over IP services
    - Unreliable, unordered datagram service
    - Addresses **multiplexing** of multiple connections/flows/processes
- Multiplexing
    - 16-bit port numbers
    - Well-known ports included in this (eg. SSH: 22, Telnet: 23, HTTP: 80, etc.)
- UDP header format:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/udph.PNG) 
    - 8-byte UDP header
    - Checksum: Uses IP checksum algorithm
    - NOTE: Addresses and others stored in IP header alongside this

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Reliable byte stream
- Multiplexing
    - Equivalent to UDP
- Checksum
    - Equivalent to UDP, mandatory
- Implements congestion control
    - Flow control to restrict sender rate to something manageable by receiver
    - Congestion control to restrict sender to something manageable by network
    - Both need to handle the presence of other traffic
- Connection oriented
    - Explicit setup and teardown required

Reliable Transmission (TCP vs Direct Link)
- End-to-end bandwidth/capability varies depending on:
    - Minimum link speed on route
    - Buffering capacity at destination
    - Other traffic competes for most links
    - **Requires global congestion strategy**
- RTT varies...
    - Among peers
    - Over time
    - **Requires adaptive approach to retransmission (and window size)**

End-to-End Argument
- Why not implement more functionality (ordering, congestion control) in IP?
    - A function should not be provided in the lower levels of the system unless it can be completely and correctly implemented in that level
- In-order delivery
    - In-order delivery guarantee is not robust to path changes or multiple paths
- Resource allocation
    - Hop-by-hop resource allocation doesn't guarantee optimal resource allocation

TCP Data Transport
- Data broken into segments
    - Limited by maximum segment size (MSS)
    - MSS defaults to 352 bytes
    - Typically set to MTU (maximum transmission unit) of the directly connected network (sender), minus the size of the TCP and IP headers
- TCP byte stream:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/tcpbs.PNG) 
- TCP segment header format:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/tcpsh.PNG) 
    - 16-bit source and destination ports
    - 32-bit send and ACK sequence numbers
    - 16-bit advertised window
        - Space remaining in receive window
    - 6-bit flags
        - URG: Segment contains urgent data
        - ACK: ACK sequence number is valid
        - PSH: Do not delay delivery of data
        - RST: Reset connection (rejection or termination)
        - SYN: Synchronize segment for setup
        - FIN: Final segment for teardown

TCP Sliding Window Protocol
- Sequence numbers
    - Indices into byte stream
- ACK sequence numbers
    - Actually next byte expected as opposed to last byte received
- Advertised window
    - Enables dynamic receive window size
- Receive buffers
    - Data ready for delivery to application until requested
    - Out-of-order data out to maximum buffer capacity  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/tcpr.PNG) 

- Sender buffers
    - Unacknowledged data
    - Unsent data out to maximum buffer capacity  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/tcps.PNG) 

Flow vs Congestion Control
- Flow control
    - Preventing senders from overrunning capacity of the receivers
- Congestion control
    - Preventing too much data from being injected into the network, causing switches or links to become overloaded
- TCP provides both
    - Flow control based on advertised window
    - Congestion control discussed later

TCP Flow Control
- Receiving side
    - Receive buffer size = `MaxRcvBuffer`
    - `LastByteRcvd - LastByteRead <= MaxRcvBuffer`
    - `AdvertisedWindow = MaxRcvBuffer - (NextByteExpected - NextByteRead)`
        - Shrinks as data arrives
        - Grows as the application consumes data
- Sending side
    - Send buffer size = `MaxSendBuffer`
    - `LastByteSent - LastByteAcked <= AdvertisedWindow`
    - `EffectiveWindow = AdvertisedWindow - (LastByteSent - LastByteAcked)`
        - `EffectiveWindow > 0` to send data
    - `LastByteWritten - LastByteAcked <= MaxSendBuffer`
    - Block the sender if `(LastByteWritten - LastByteAcked) + y > MaxSenderBuffer`
- **Problem 1:** Slow receiver application
    - Advertised window goes to 0
    - Sender cannot send more data
    - Receiver may not spontaneously generate update or update may be lost
- **Solution:** Sender periodically sends 1-byte segment to trigger the response from receiver
- **Problem 2:** Sender application delivers tiny pieces of data to TCP
    - Ex: `telnet` in character mode
    - Each piece sent as a segment
    - Very inefficient
- **Solution:** Delay transmission to accumulate more data
    - **Nagle's Algorithm**
        - Send first piece of data
        - Accumulate data until first piece ACK'd
        - Send accumulated data and restart accumulation
- **Problem 3:** Slow application reads data in tiny pieces
    - Receiver advertises tiny window
    - Sender fills tiny window
    - Known as the **silly window syndrome**
- **Solution:** Advertise window opening only when MSS of 1/2 of buffer is available
    - Sender delays sending until window is MSS or 1/2 of receiver's buffer (estimated)

TCP Sequence Numbers - 32-bit
- Sequence numbers vs packet lifetime

TCP Advertised Window - 16-bit
- Advertised window can be as large as $2^{16}$ bytes, which is approximated as 64KB
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/tcp16.PNG) 

Sequence Number vs Advertised Window
- 32-bit sequence number, and 16-bit advertised window
    - $2^{332} \gg 2 * 2^{16}$: Good!
- TCP extensions
    - 64-bit identifier (32-bit sequence number + 32 bit time stamp)
    - Scaling factor for advertised window

TCP Adaptive Retransmission Algorithm
- **Original**
    - Theory
        - Estimate RTT
        - Multiply by 2 to allow for variations
    - Practice
        - Use exponential moving average (A = 0.1 to 0.2)
        - Estimate = (A) * measurement + (1 - A) * estimate
    - Problem
        - Did not handle variations well
        - Ambiguity for retransmitted packets if no explicit timestamp used
- **Karn-Partridge**
    - Algorithm
        - Exclude retransmitted packets from RTT estimate
        - For each retransmission
            - Double previous RTT estimate
            - Exponential backoff from congestion
    - Problem
        - Still did not handle variations well
        - Did not solve network congestion problems as well as desired
- **Jacobson-Karels**
    - Algorithm
        - Estimate variance of RTT
            - Calculate mean interpacket RTT deviation to approximate variance
            - Deviation = (B) * \| RTT_Estimate - Measurement \| + (1 - B) * deviation
            - B = 0.25 for RTT_Estimate
        - Use variance estimate as component of RTT estimate
            - Next_RTT = RTT_Estimate + 4 * Deviation
        - **Protects against high jitter**
