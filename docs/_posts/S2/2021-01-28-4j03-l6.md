Media Access Control
===

Multiple Access Media
- Multiple senders on some media
    - Buses (Ethernet, all connecting off one line)
    - Wireless, Satellite (Shared)
    - Token Ring (Connected to one another)
- Need methods to moderate access to media
    - Fair arbitration (each node has equal access)
    - Good performance (overall throughput maxed)
- Why don't we adopt fully connected network topology as LAN (local area network) topology?
    - No need for packet switching, but the number of connections grows quadratically with the number of nodes, so it is impractical with many devices

Multiple Access Control
- **Problem**: Demands can conflict (eg. two hosts send simultaneously)
    - Solution is a **Medium Access Control (MAC) algorithm**
- **Potential Solutions** (of many)
    - Carrier sense multiple access with collision detections (CSMA/CD)
        - Send only if medium is idle
        - Stop sending immediately if collision detected
    - Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    - Token ring/fiber distributed data interface (FDDA)
        - Pass a token around a ring, only token holder sends

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
- Used by Ethernet
    - Xerox and IEEE 802.3 (10Mbps standard)
    - IEEE 802.3u (Fast ethernet, 100Mbps standard)
    - Current Cat7 cable offers 10Gbps within 100m
- Goal: **Distributed** algorithm that provides **fair and efficient** access to a share medium

Ethernet MAC Algorithm
- Sender/Transmitter
    - If line is idle:
        - Send immediately
        - Send maximum of 1500B data
        - Wait 9.6 $\mu s$ before sending again
    - If line is busy
        - Wait until line becomes idle
        - When idle, send immediately (called **1-persistent strategy**)
    - If collision detected
        - Stop sending and jam signal (inform other nodes that a collision occurred, letting them know to discard the message)
        - Try again later
- Given the following image;
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/nab.PNG) 
    How can we ensure that *A* knows about the collision?
- **Collision Detection**
    - Example
        - Node A's message reaches node B at time *T*
        - Node B's message reaches node A at time *2T*
        - For node A to detect a collision, node *A* must still be transmitting at time *2T*
    - For 802.3...
        - *2T* is bounded to 51.2 $\mu s \rightarrow$ Distance limit of Ethernet is 7000m
        - At 10Mbps, 51.2 $\mu s$ = 512b, or 64B
        - Packet length $\geq$ 64B $\rightarrow$ If capacity is getting larger, the packet size should be larger accordingly
    - Jam after collision
        - Ensures that all hosts notice the collision
- At time *2T*, *A* is still transmitting and notices a collision
