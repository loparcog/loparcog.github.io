Internet
===

Internet Protocol (IP)
- Network-layer protocol for the Internet
- Operates on all hosts and routers
    - Routers are nodes connecting different networks for the Internet
- All running same IP protocol for uniformity, "hourglass figure"

Message Transmission
- Internet consists of collection of heterogeneous networks, but different routing networks are used  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/mt.PNG) 
    - Only one IP protocol is used to make sure a message can be transferred from one host to another
- Example of Alice transmitting a message to Bob:

IPv4 Address Model
- Uses 32-bit address space, providing $2^{23}$ unique addresses
    - Large blocks are reserved for special use
- Address usually written in **dot-decimal form**, splitting the address into four one byte/eight bits each, each having a range from 0 to 255  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/dd.PNG) 
- Properties
    - 32-bit address
    - Hierarchical
        - Network, subnet, host hierarchy
    - Maps to logically unique network adaptor
- Each IP holds room for the network and host address, ranging in **three classes**:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ipc.PNG) 
    - If an IP address is given, you can tell which class it is a part of based on the leading bits
- Detailed information of IPv4 address models:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/dd2.PNG) 
    - Number of networks means number of unique network addresses in each class, same with addresses
    - The $-2$ in the addresses is because all 0's means a network address and all 1's means a broadcast address
- Address classes: If the first octet has a value between...
    - 0 - 127: Class *A* address
    - 128 - 191: Class *B* address
    - 192 - 223: Class *C* address
    - 224 - 239: Class *D* address
- Examples
    - Host in class *A* network: **23**.9.102.222
        - Large companies or organizations tend to use class *A*
    - Host in class *B* network: **172**.17.49.36
        - Medium organizations or Universities like McMaster tend to use class *B*

IPv4 Address Translation Support
- **Problem:** IP addresses translation to LAN physical addresses
- Recall...
    - An IP route can pass through many physical networks
    - Data must be delivered to destination's physical network
    - Hosts only listen for packets marked with physical interface names
- In example before, Alice would need to know address of Rick, and Rick would need to know address of Bob, for proper data transfer
- How can we translate IP to physical address translation?
    - **Hard-coded**: Encode physical address in IP address
        - Not always possible, not sure which host will use the given network adapter
    - **Centralized table**: Maintain a central repository and distribute to hosts
        - Bottleneck for queries and updates
    - **Build a table using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Each host has a table, use timeouts to clean up table

ARP
- Check table for physical address
- If address not present
    - Broadcast an ARP query, wait for a response
- Upon receipt of ARP query/response
    - Target host responds with address translation
    - If address already present
        - Refresh entry and reset timeout
    - If address not present
        - Add entry for requesting host
- Timeout and discard entries after *O(10)* minutes
- ARP packet format:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/arppf.PNG)
    - Purple/yellow addresses are physical addresses, green are IP addresses

Datagram Forwarding with IP
- Hosts and routers maintain forwarding tables
    - List of *<network/host, next hop>* pairs
    - Send directly to host on same network
    - Send indirectly (via router onn same network) to host on different network
    - Use ARP to get hardware address of host/router

IP Fragmentation and Reassembly
- **Problem**: Different physical layers provide different limits on frame length
    - Maximum transmission unit (MTU)
    - Source host does not known minimum size values to fulfil MTU, especially along dynamic routes
- **Solution**: When necessary, split IP packet into acceptably sized packets prior to sending over physical link
    - Where should reassembly occur?
    - What happens when a fragment is damaged/lost?
- Fragments are self-contained IP datagrams
- Reassemble at destination to minimize *refragmentation*
    - Since all frames may not follow the same route
- Drop all fragments in packet if one or more fragments are lost
- Avoid fragmentation at source host
    - Network layer packets should be small enough to fit into one MTU of local physical network
    - Must consider IP header
- IP packet format:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ippf.PNG)
    - Explained more below!
    - All fragments should share the same `Ident` field (ID)
    - Flags to be set to say if it is the last fragment in the packet
    - Offset specifies the offset of the segment in the packet

IP Packet Format
- Fragmentation support
    - 16-bit packet ID
        - All fragments from the same packet have the same ID
    - 3-bit flags
        - 1-bit to mark last fragment
    - 13-bit fragment offset into packet
        - Counter in 8-byte words
- 8-bit TTL field (time-to-live)
    - Hop count decremented at each router
    - Packet discarded if TTL = 0
- Example fragmentation:

IPv4 Address Exhaustion
- IPv4 supports roughly 4 billion addresses
    - 128 class *A* network addresses
    - $2^{14} = 16,384$ class *B* network addresses
    - $2^{21}$: ~ 1 million level class *C* network addresses
    - NOTE: Even in these classes, some go wasted/unused
- Problems of scale
    - What networks should be allocated to a company with 1000 machines?
        - Class *C* network contains 256 host addresses, so it's not enough to cover 1000 hosts. However a class *B* can hold it, but a large amount of the IP addresses will be wasted
    - What about a company with 100 machines?
        - Class *C* can be assigned, but still more than half the addresses will be wasted
    - What about a company with 2 machines that plans to grow rapidly?
        - Unsure how many hosts will be in the company in the future, hard to assign which network the company should use
- Main problems
    - Inefficient address allocation
- Possible solutions include...
    - DHCP-like protocols
    - NAT
    - CIDR: Subnetting and supernetting
    - IPv6

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Plug new host into network
    - How much information must be known?
    - What new information must be assigned?
    - How can process be automated?
- Some answers...
    - Host needs an IP address and must know it
    - Host mus also...
        - Send packets out physical (direct) network
        - Thus needs physical address of routers
- A simple way to automate configuration information
    - New machine sends request to DHCP server, and the server assigns an IP address
    - Network administrator does not need to enter host IP address by hand
    - Good for large and/or dynamic networks
- Example diagram:
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/dhcp.PNG)

Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Solution to the problem of limited address space
    - No need for globally unique addresses
    - Use locally unique addresses inside an organization
    - Translate from locally unique address to globally unique NAT address
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/nat.PNG)

Subnetting
- **Motivation**: An organization needs $2^{10} = 1024$ IP addresses. Which class of network address should be assigned to the organization
    - No way to do this without either being short or wasting many addresses
- Subnetting takes bits away from the host address and adds a new section for the subnet address, essentially acting as an extension of the network address and wasting less addresses
- Example with representing a class *C* network from a class *B* network:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ccbs.PNG)
- If we know the subnet mask, which is an IP with all bits of the network and the subnet set to 1's, then we can tell what the host/subnet number is by the IP:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/sub.PNG)
    - Subnet number also known as subnet address
- Subnet example sending from *H1* to *H3*:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/subex.PNG)

Supernetting
- Combine multiple class *C* addresses for a larger network
- Use contiguous blocks of class *C* addresses
    - Example: `192.4.16 - 192.4.31`, 20 bit subnet mask, makes a range of 16 class *C* networks
    - Block size must be a power of 2
- Image of example:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/sup.PNG)

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
- Allows hierarchical development
    - Subnetting: Share one address (network number) across multiple physical networks
    - Supernetting: Aggregate multiple addresses (network numbers) for one physical network

IPv6 Addresses
- 128-bit
    - $3.4 * 10^{38}$ addresses (more than $7.9 * 10^{28}$ times as many as IPv4)
- Address notation
    - String of eight 16-bit hex values separated by colons
        - `5CFA:0002:0000:0000:CF07:1234:5678:FFCD`
    - Set of contiguous 0's can be elided
        - `5CFA:0002::0000:CF07:1234:5678:FFCD`
