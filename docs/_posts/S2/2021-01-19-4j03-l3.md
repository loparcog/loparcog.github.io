Modulation and Source Coding Cont.

QAM - Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
- QAM generalizes MPSK by varying *A* as well (combining phase and amplitude modulation)

- If one signal represents more bits, we will be able to achieve a higher data rate
    - But, can one signal represent as many bits as we want?
    - No, due to **noise**

How Fast can Data be Transmitted on a Noisy Channel?
- Noise blurs the symbols, reducing the number of symbols that can be readily distinguished
- **Baud Rate** is how many signals can be transmitted in a unit of time, which is typically limited by electrical signalling properties
    - The equation would be $R_{Baud} = (\text{Bits per signal})/R_{Bit}$
- In 1948, Claude Shannon gave the **formula of channel capacity** as:  
    $$ C = B \log_2(1 + S/N)$$  
    - *C* is the channel capacity, and the theoretical upper bound on bit rate
    - *B* is the channel bandwidth
        - The frequency range of a connector (eg. 300Hz to 3300Hz would have a bandwidth of 3000Hz)
        - NOT the rate that bits can be sent over
    - *S/N* is the ratio between signal power and noise power

Noisy Channel Data Rates
- A telephone line is known to have a loss of 20db. The input signal power is measured as 0.5 watts and the output noise is measured at 4.5 $\mu$ watt. Using this information, calculate the output signal-to-noise ratio in DB
    - Let $P_1 = 0.5$ be the input power level, and $P_2$ be the output power level we need to find:  
        $$10 \log(P_2/P_1) = -20db \rightarrow P_2 / P_1 = 0.01$$  
        Since $P_1 = 0.5$ watt, $P_2 = 0.005$ watt
    - We can then calculate the signal to noise ratio $SNR$ with the following equation:  
        $$SNR = P_2 / N_o$$  
        where $N_o$ is the output noise  
        $$SNR = 0.005/(4.5 * 10^{-6}) = 1.11 * 10^3$$  
        To convert this to DB, we use the following:  
        $$10 \log(1.11 * 10^3) = 30dB$$
- What is the capacity of the given phone line with a frequency range of 300 Hz - 3300Hz?
    - We can fill out the formula for channel capacity as follows:  
        $$C = 3000 \log_2(1 + 1.11*10^3)$$  
        $$C = 3000 * 10.12 = 30352.93$$
- If the attenuation rate of this phone line is $2dB/km$, and the minimum output signal is 0.001 watt, given the input signal from before, how long can the phone line be before requiring a repeater?
    - This length can be calculated using the same power ratio formula, but setting the output power to the minimum values of 0.001 watts:  
        $$10 log(P_2 / P_1) = 10 log(0.001/0.5) = -26.99 dB$$  
        We can now convert this into length:  
        $$-26.99dB/(2dB/km) = -13.49 km$$
