Modulation and Source Coding Cont.
===

QAM - Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
- QAM generalizes MPSK by varying *A* as well (combining phase and amplitude modulation)

- If one signal represents more bits, we will be able to achieve a higher data rate
    - But, can one signal represent as many bits as we want?
    - No, due to **noise**

How Fast can Data be Transmitted on a Noisy Channel?
- Noise blurs the symbols, reducing the number of symbols that can be readily distinguished
- **Baud Rate** is how many signals can be transmitted in a unit of time, which is typically limited by electrical signalling properties
- In 1948, Claude Shannon gave the formula of channel capacity as:  
    $$ C = B \log_2(1 + S/N)$$  
    - *C* is the channel capacity, and the theoretical upper bound on bit rate
    - *B* is the channel bandwidth
    - *S/N* is the ratio between signal power and noise power
