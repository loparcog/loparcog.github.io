Security and Attacks Cont.
===

Denial-of-Service Attacks: Reflection
- Cause one non-compromised host to attack another
- Eg. Host *A* sends DNS request or TCP SYN with source *V* to server *R*, and *R* sends a reply to *V*

IP Traceback
- Routers probabilistically tag packets with an identifier
- Destination can infer path to true source after receiving enough packets

Firewalls
- A **firewall** isolates organization's internal network from larger Internet (outside world), allowing some packets to pass and blocking others
    - Can also block packets from the internal network
- Why?
    - Prevent denial of service attacks: SYN flooding; attacker establishes many bogus TCP connections, no resources left for "real" connections
    - Prevent illegal modification/access of internal data: eg. attacker replaces CIA's homepage with something else
    - Allow only authorized access to inside network: Set of authenticated users/hosts
- Two types of firewalls:
    1. Packet-filtering: Stateless vs stateful, lower level implementation
    2. Application-level (also known as application-gateway)

Stateless Packet Filtering
- Internal network connected to internet via **router firewall**
- Router *filters packet-by-packet* decision to forward/drop packet based on:
    - Source/destination IP address
    - TCP/UDP source/destination port numbers
    - ICMP message type
    - TCP SYN and ACK bits

Packet Filtering Ex
- Ex1: Block incoming and outgoing datagrams with IP protocol field = 17 and with either source or dest port = 23
    - Block UCP datagrams since that is the IP protocol 17
    - Disable telnet since port 23 is used for telnet
- Ex2: Block inbound TCP segments with ACK = 0
    - Prevents any new TCP connections from external hosts
    - Internal hosts can still start connections though

Stateful Packet Filtering
- Stateless packet filtering is a heavy handed tool
    - Admits packets that "make no sense", eg. source port = 80, ACK bit set, even though no TCP connection established
- Stateful packet filtering tracks the status of every TCP connection
    - Track connection setup (SYN), teardown (FIN): determine whether incoming and outgoing packets "make sense"
    - Timeout inactive connections at firewall, no longer admit packets
- **Access Control List (ACL)** augmented to indicate need to check connection state table before admitting packet

Application Gateways
- Filters packets on application data as well as on IP/TCP/UDP fields
    - Ex: Allow selected internal users to telnet outside
    1. Require all telnet users to telnet through gateway
    2. For authorized users, gateway sets up telnet connection to destination host. Gatewat relays data between 2 connections
    3. Router filter blocks all telnet connections not originating from gateway

Limitations of Firewalls and Gateways
- **IP spoofing**: Router can't know if data "really" comes from claimed source
- If multiple applications need special treatment, each will have their own application gateway
- For application gateways, client software must know how to contact gateway
    - eg. Must set IP address of proxy in Web browser
- Filters often use all or nothing policy for UDP
- Tradeoff between degree of communication with outside world and level of security
- Many highly protected sites still suffer from attacks

Security Primers
===

Friends and Enemies: Alice, Bob, Trudy
- Well-known in network security world
- Bob and Alice (lovers) want to communicate "securely"
- Trudy (intruder) poses threat to the communication
- What can a bad person/intruder do?
    - Eavesdrop: intercept messages
    - Actively insert/modify messages into connection
    - Impersonation: Can fake (spoof) source address in packet (or any field in packet)
    - Hijacking: "Take over" ongoing connection by removing sender or receiver, inserting themselves in place
    - Denial of Service: Prevent service from being used by others (eg. by overloading resources)

The Language of Cryptography
- **Symmetric Key** crypto: sender, receiver keys *identical*
- **Public Key** crypto: encryption key *public*, decryption key *secret* (private)

Symmetric Key Cryptography
- **Substitution Cipher**: Substituting one thing for another
    - Monoalphabetic cipher: substitute one letter for another
- Q: How hard to break this simple cipher?
    - Brute force (26!)
    - Other?
