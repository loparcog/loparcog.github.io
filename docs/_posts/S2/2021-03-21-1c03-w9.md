Module 15: Water Resources
===

Water and Sustainability
- **Freshwater** is a renewable resource which ecosystems and all living beings depend on
    - Represents only a small fraction of water resource, with most of it in ice caps and therefore inaccessible
    - Also estimated most groundwater is deep beneath the surface and can only be extracted with great difficulty
    - As a result, most of the freshwater we depend on is either at the surface or just beneath it
- Freshwater resources across the globe are unevenly distributed, with some countries having far more access than others
    - Often a fact of geography and is a limiting factor in many parts across the world
- Wetlands play a key role in the water cycle and renewed access to it
    - **Wetlands** are areas where the land is saturated to a depth of a few centimetres for at least a few days per year
    - This contributes to a lack of oxygen and the build up of nutrients, making these areas highly productive
    - Vegetation that adapts to this land can thrive
    - Conditions required for the development for wetland soils include
        - Poor drainage
        - Saturation that may be a few days or the entire year
        - Lack of oxygen that develops from soil saturation
        - Growth of adapted vegetation
- Wetlands accomplish several natural functions
    - Act as natural sponges for water; storing water during periods of high river flow and slowly releasing it during low flow
    - Act as buffers from storms and high waves for coastal and inland areas
- Wetlands are areas of **groundwater recharge/discharge** depending on the surrounding conditions
    - Highly productive where many nutrients and chemicals are cycled within wetlands
    - Play an important role in the carbon cycle as well as they are storage sites for organic carbon
    - Also help purify water by trapping sediment and toxins
- Wetlands also act as nursery grounds for many species of fish, shellfish, and aquatic birds
    - Host high percentages of endangered animals and plants
- Globally, the rate of water withdrawal is growing exponentially, but varies worldwide
    - Most water withdrawn is used for irrigation, and most of this is lost to evaporation
    - More than half of global surface runoff is used
    - After irrigation, the next big users are industry residences and cities
    - Therefore important to distinguish between **consumptive use** (water removed from an aquifier or surface water body and not returned) and **non consumptive use** (water removed temporarily)
    - Stress on water resources varies as a function of water availability and consumption
- Given the limited amount of freshwater, its important for water resources to be used sustainably
    - Sustainable use occurs in a manner that allows society to develop and flourish into the future without degrading various component of the hydrologic cycle or the ecological system that depend on it
    - **Use of water resources must not exceed its recharge**
- What can we do to achieve this?
    - Ensure a sufficient volume of water is available to maintain human and ecosystem well being
    - Minimum standards of water quality must be adhered to
    - Actions damaging long-term renewability of water must be eliminated
    - Promote water conservation
- On a daily basis, a higher percentage of water is wasted than used
    - Less than half of the water diverted for irrigation reaches crops (see flooding irrigation methods)
    - Most households waste for bathroom use

Impacts of Diversions
- Shortages of water can be combatted by different ways of increasing water supplies
    - Build dams and reservoirs to store runoff
    - Bring in surface water from other areas through aqueducts, canals, channels, and pipelines
    - Withdraw more groundwater
    - Desalinate salt water to make it freshwater
    - Improve efficiency of water usage
- Dams and reservoirs often the center of strategies to deal with water shortages
    - Store water, regulate runoff, and therefore prevent floods
    - Provide water in times of drought, recreational areas, and possibly power generation if large enough
    - Dams come with some disadvantages though
        - Can be subject to failure if poorly designed/constructed
        - Alter the natural flow of rivers, interfering with the life cycle of fish
        - Large surface areas of reservoirs evaporate large amounts of water, representing a significant loss
- Aral Sea in former USSR is a famous example of the mismanagement of water resources
    - Water transfer sunk the sea to the point it is no longer capable to provide the same ecosystem services it used to
    - Reduction in size led to several changes
        - Tripled in salinity
        - 80% volume reduction
        - Several native fish/bird species are now extinct
        - Surrounding forest/croplands destroyed due to the alteration of the local hydrological regime
        - The sea no longer acts as a thermal buffer
        - Water table contaminated by salts and residents in the area suffer from health problems because of the dust from the dry seabed
