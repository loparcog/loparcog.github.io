Module 15: Water Resources
===

Water and Sustainability
- **Freshwater** is a renewable resource which ecosystems and all living beings depend on
    - Represents only a small fraction of water resource, with most of it in ice caps and therefore inaccessible
    - Also estimated most groundwater is deep beneath the surface and can only be extracted with great difficulty
    - As a result, most of the freshwater we depend on is either at the surface or just beneath it
- Freshwater resources across the globe are unevenly distributed, with some countries having far more access than others
    - Often a fact of geography and is a limiting factor in many parts across the world
- Wetlands play a key role in the water cycle and renewed access to it
    - **Wetlands** are areas where the land is saturated to a depth of a few centimetres for at least a few days per year
    - This contributes to a lack of oxygen and the build up of nutrients, making these areas highly productive
    - Vegetation that adapts to this land can thrive
    - Conditions required for the development for wetland soils include
        - Poor drainage
        - Saturation that may be a few days or the entire year
        - Lack of oxygen that develops from soil saturation
        - Growth of adapted vegetation
- Wetlands accomplish several natural functions
    - Act as natural sponges for water; storing water during periods of high river flow and slowly releasing it during low flow
    - Act as buffers from storms and high waves for coastal and inland areas
- Wetlands are areas of **groundwater recharge/discharge** depending on the surrounding conditions
    - Highly productive where many nutrients and chemicals are cycled within wetlands
    - Play an important role in the carbon cycle as well as they are storage sites for organic carbon
    - Also help purify water by trapping sediment and toxins
- Wetlands also act as nursery grounds for many species of fish, shellfish, and aquatic birds
    - Host high percentages of endangered animals and plants
- Globally, the rate of water withdrawal is growing exponentially, but varies worldwide
    - Most water withdrawn is used for irrigation, and most of this is lost to evaporation
    - More than half of global surface runoff is used
    - After irrigation, the next big users are industry residences and cities
    - Therefore important to distinguish between **consumptive use** (water removed from an aquifier or surface water body and not returned) and **non consumptive use** (water removed temporarily)
    - Stress on water resources varies as a function of water availability and consumption
- Given the limited amount of freshwater, its important for water resources to be used sustainably
    - Sustainable use occurs in a manner that allows society to develop and flourish into the future without degrading various component of the hydrologic cycle or the ecological system that depend on it
    - **Use of water resources must not exceed its recharge**
- What can we do to achieve this?
    - Ensure a sufficient volume of water is available to maintain human and ecosystem well being
    - Minimum standards of water quality must be adhered to
    - Actions damaging long-term renewability of water must be eliminated
    - Promote water conservation
- On a daily basis, a higher percentage of water is wasted than used
    - Less than half of the water diverted for irrigation reaches crops (see flooding irrigation methods)
    - Most households waste for bathroom use

Impacts of Diversions
- Shortages of water can be combatted by different ways of increasing water supplies
    - Build dams and reservoirs to store runoff
    - Bring in surface water from other areas through aqueducts, canals, channels, and pipelines
    - Withdraw more groundwater
    - Desalinate salt water to make it freshwater
    - Improve efficiency of water usage
- Dams and reservoirs often the center of strategies to deal with water shortages
    - Store water, regulate runoff, and therefore prevent floods
    - Provide water in times of drought, recreational areas, and possibly power generation if large enough
    - Dams come with some disadvantages though
        - Can be subject to failure if poorly designed/constructed
        - Alter the natural flow of rivers, interfering with the life cycle of fish
        - Large surface areas of reservoirs evaporate large amounts of water, representing a significant loss
- Aral Sea in former USSR is a famous example of the mismanagement of water resources
    - Water transfer sunk the sea to the point it is no longer capable to provide the same ecosystem services it used to
    - Reduction in size led to several changes
        - Tripled in salinity
        - 80% volume reduction
        - Several native fish/bird species are now extinct
        - Surrounding forest/croplands destroyed due to the alteration of the local hydrological regime
        - The sea no longer acts as a thermal buffer
        - Water table contaminated by salts and residents in the area suffer from health problems because of the dust from the dry seabed

Module 16: Soils
===

Soil Horizons
- **Soil** is a natural body consisting of layers and horizons, and/or organic material of variable thickness
    - Differs from the parent material by its morphology, chemical/physical properties, mineralogy and biology
    - Overwhelming majority of global food supply comes from agricultural systems
- Soil plays an important role in nutrient cycling, and in particular the nitrogen cycle
    - Soil hosts many organisms, including decomposers and "detritus feeders", which break down dead organic material
- Soils have been important for humans throughout history, as a cheap and available building material
    - Failure to understand the properties of soil can lead to catastrophes though, like the 1976 Titon Dam failure, which was made of soil
- Physical, chemical, and biological processes break down the parent material into smaller particles, which make up the mineral components of soil
- A **soil profile** is a vertical arrangement of all the soil horizons down to the parent material known as the **bedrock**
- A **soil horizon** is a layer of mineral organic soil, or soil material approximately parallel to the land surface and has characteristic representing alteration by soil formation processes. There are different types of mineral horizons
    - **O Horizon**: Organic rich layer, contains more than 17% organic carbon by weight, with varying composition as the organic matter may come from leaves/twigs/wood, or from dead plants
        - In some, the accumulated matter bears little/no resemblance to the original material
    - **A Horizon**: Litter/topsoil, zone of mineral leaching
    - **B Horizon**: Subsoil, zone where leeched organic and/or mineral material such as iron oxides accumulate
    - **C Horizon**: Transition zone, just above the parent material and largely unaffected by the soil forming processes operating in A and B
- **Topsoil** is the outermost layer of inorganic soil, and is made up of organic matter, minteral particles, and an interactive food web
    - Area of intense biological activity crucial to the cycling of nutrients

Soil Texture and Structure
- Weathering of rocks produces smaller and smaller fragments called **grains and soil**
    - **Texture** si the size of these soil particles, measured as the diameter of the fragments
        - Sand is 0.05-2 mm in diameter 
        - Silt has a diameter between 0.002 and 0.05 mm
        - Clay below 0.002 mm
    - Size of the grain determines how they will be arranged relative to one another, and what the pore sizes will be in the soil
        - Determines how air and water travels between soil particles
- When thinking about **soil porosity**, two considerations must be made
    1. Soils with larger particles have larger pores, therefore greater aeration and infiltration
    2. Smaller particles tend to have more surface area relative to volume so nutrients and water molecules tend to cling to those surfaces
- Grain size can be determined in several ways
    - In the field, rubbing between teeth or rolling it in your mouth and spitting
    - In the lab, sieves can be used
    - Smaller particles determined by measuring the time it takes for the soil to settle in water, known as the settling law
- Relative abundance of each type of material can determine which category the soil belongs to using the **soil texture triangle**
    - Sides of the triangle represent percent salt, clay, and silt
    - Note only inorganic solids are taken into account in this classification
- **Soil Structure** describes the combination of primary soil particles into secondary particles
    - Instead of being isolated, soil particles are held together in a single mass/cluster
    - Combination/arrangement of primary soil particles into secondary are called **aggregates/PEDs**
    - Larger aggregates are composed of smaller, more stable aggregates 
- Important to understand the structure of a soil, as it defines the nature of the system of pores and channels in soils
- Nomenclature of soil structure helps to describe their shape, size, and degree of development
    - Granular structure typically has a diameter of 1-10mm, usually found in *A* horizon, but can also be in *B* and *C*
    - Blocky structure ranges in size from 5-50mm, usually found in *B* horizons rich in clay
        - Typically designated as angular or subangular
    - Prismatic structure ranges in size from 10-100mm, also usually found in clay-rich *B* horizons
        - If the columns have rounded tops, the structure is columnar
    - Platy structure ranges from 1-10mm, found in horizons which are zones of leaching with less humus and minerals resistant to leaching
        - May also occur in some *B* horizons
- Soil aggregates may form through abiotic physical and chemical processes
    - Flocculation of clays is a condition where small changed particles become attached and clump together, promoted by ions such as calcium 2+, aluminum 3+, magnesium 2+, and iron 3+
    - Soil, water, pH, temperature, salinity, all play a role
    - Volume changes in clay materials is due to a difference in properties
        - eg. Under varying moisture conditions, clay can be sticky or hard
- Soil aggregates can also form through biological processes
    - Intervention of soil organisms
    - Interaction of soil with organic matter

Soil Properties
- **Nutrient**: Any chemical required for the proper functioning of living organisms
    - Plants rely on the nutrient holding capacity of soil
    - **Nutrient Holding Capacity**: Soil's capacity to bind and hold nutrients
    - Nutrients removed in agriculture when material is harvested, so more is needed such as through fertilizers (can be organic/inorganic)
- **Water Holding Capacity**: Soils capacity to bind and hold water
    - Critical property as plants take water from the soil to grow
    - Soil gains water through precipitation
        - If porous, the water will infiltrate, if compact, water will be lost as runoff
    - If WHC is good, plants will use the water and return it as the evapotranspiration of the local water system, if bad, water will migrate downwards to the aquifer and not be accessible to plants at the surface
- Interaction between plants, soils, and atmosphere are complex
    - Plants protect soil from erosion and evaporative water loss
    - Different factors affect plant's chance to grow in that soil
    - Soil fertility depends on the source of nutrients where weathering of parent rock releases nutrients at a slow rate, but the decay of detritus in organisms releases them much faster
    - Soils need to be porous to promote aeration
    - Soil water can come from the hydrologic cycle or irrigation
    - Most plants require soil water to have a neutral pH of 7
    - Salt buildup reduces the ability of plant roots to take in water
        - If salt is high enough, water can be taken out of the plant
- **Leaching** is a process where materials are removed from the soil by water
    - Can be a major problem, reducing soil fertility and can contribute to water pollution
- **Soil Communities** are made up of fungi, bacteria, protozoa, insects, and large animals
    - Soil organisms critical in the formation of humus, which is partly decomposed organic matter
    - Soil microbes then work to regenerate humus
- Gain of humus results in more topsoil formed and improved water and nutrient holding capacity and airation
    - Loss of humus results in topsoil becoming rich in minerals, reducing the above soil characteristics
