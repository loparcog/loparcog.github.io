Subnets and Hierarchical Addressing
===

Subnet Ex1
- Subnet with 24 prefix part (share common network up to the first 24 bits or 3 bytes)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/snex1.PNG)
- Q: How many subnets? 
    - 3
- Q: What is the notation for the subnets?
    - **223.1.1**.0/24, **223.1.2**.0/24, and **223.1.3**.0/24
    - First 24 bits the same, and it is noted at the end as the */24*

Subnets Ex2
- Subnet with 24 prefix part  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/snex2.PNG)
- Q: How many subnets?
    - 6 (3 for the hosts and 3 for the links connecting the interfaces)
- Q: What are the notations of the subnets?
    - Links have 223.1.7.0/24, 223.1.8.0/24, and 223.1.9.0/24
    - Hosts have 223.1.1.0/24, 223.1.2.0/24, and 223.1.3.0/24

Hierarchical Addressing: Allocation
- Internet Corporation for Assigned Named and Numbers (ICANN) assigns IP address portion to...
    - Regional Internet Registries, which assigns subnet portion to...
        - Large institutions (ISPs), which assign addresses to...
            - Hosts

Hierarchical Addressing: Route Aggregation
- Hierarchical addressing allows efficient advertisement of routing information:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hara.PNG)
    - The whole collection matches the request since they all match in the first 20 bits
    - Look for common prefixes to group, specifically the shortest prefix comminality to match with the request
- In some cases, some ISPs may have more specific route  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hara2.PNG)
    - Will give the packet to the more specific matching address, so in this case, ISPs-R-Us instead of Fly-By-Night-ISP

IP Addresses: How to get One?
- Q: How does a host get an IP address?
- A: Hard-coded by system admin in a file or using **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**, which dynamically gets address from a server
    - DHCP essentially acts as a "plug-and-play", using any address it is given

DHCP Info
- DHCP message encapsulated in UDP, encapsulated in IP
- *Goal*: Allow host to *dynamically* obtain its IP address from network server when it joins network
    - Can **renew** its lease on address in use
    - Allows **reuse** of addresses (only hold address while connected/"on")
    - Support for mobile users who want to join network (more shortly)
    - NOTE: Client does not need to take given IP
- DHCP Overview
    - Host broadcasts "DHCP discover" msg [optional]
    - DHCP server responds with "DHCP offer" msg [optional]
    - Host requests an IP address with "DHCP request" msg
    - DHCP server sends address with "DHCP ack" msg
- Client-server scenario: what would be the `dest` and `src` IP addresses?  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dhcpex.PNG)
    - Communication would look as follows (`yiaddr` is your IP address):  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dhcpex2.PNG)
        - Why not just take it?

DHCP: More than IP Addresses
- DHCP can return more than just allocated IP addresses on subnet:
    - **Address of first-hop router** for client
    - **Name and IP address** of **DNS** server
    - **Network mask** (indicating network versus host portion of the address)
