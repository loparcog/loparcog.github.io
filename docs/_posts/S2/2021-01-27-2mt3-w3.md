Music Therapy Approaches
===

Approaches
- NOTE: The terms "approach" and "model" will be used interchangeably for this course
- Do all music therapists use the same approach?
    - **No**, there are many approaches, trainings, addition trainings, etc.
    - Setting and client group can influence approach
    - Each country/health care system has different influence
    - Government/economic demands
    - Societal pressures (Evidence based practice (EBP), funding)
    - Advances in research (fMRI, EEG)
- Is one approach better than another
    - Questions should be asked to determine the best approach:
        - What is the training and strengths of the therapist?
        - What are the needs of the client?
    - More than one approach can answer these questions as well, does not need to be one specific answer
- What is the role of music
    - **Music *AS* therapy**: Some approaches focus on the music. It is the music itself that facilitates change
    - **Music *IN* therapy**: Some approaches utilize music as a tool to facilitate change
- **Creative Music Therapy** (also referred to as **Nordoff-Robbins** music therapy)
    - 1959-76: Paul Nordoff (American composer) and Clive Robbins (British special educator) believed that music did the therapy
    - Did not depend on a specific diagnosis, originally focussed on children with disabilities but has spread out
        - Identify a healthy "music-child" within each person, and this could be reached by playing with the client
    - **Music-centered** - not focused on verbal
        - Not always, can be adjusted by people using the model, but typically music-centered 
    - One individual would be making music with client, the other would be on the piano creating music "in the moment" to support the client's creativity
        - Piano music is "connecting with the music child in the person", who for example may be on the drum
    - Can be constrained due to cost (having 2 music therapists at once is costly)
    - Need specific training from accredited Nordoff-Robbins training programs to truly operate with this
        - Others may bring elements of this model in their work, but do not have the proper training to actualy do it
    - Example of music AS therapy
- **Guided Imagery Method (GIM)**
    - Post MTA training (3yrs)
    - Helen Bonney
    - Listen to pre-recorded music (classical) and create discussion around images that come to forefront after listening to image
        - Done in 1970s, currently when music replace clinical use of LSD was being tested
        - Looking into music to replace hallucinogenics
    - Activates "inner-reflection"
        - Images can be mental, visual, using any range of senses
        - Encourage clients to discuss and draw visuals that come to mind
    - Example of music IN therapy
- **Behavioral Approach**
    - The use of music as a contingent reinforcement or stimulus cue to increase/modify behavior
    - Result-driven and therapist-led
    - Ex: NICU infants using stimulus of music listening to suck for nutrition
        - When a child sucks on a pacifier, music would be played as positive reinforcement, increasing sucking behavior
        - Negative stimuli would then be the lack of music that occurs when they stop sucking
- **Cognitive Behavioral Model (CBT)**
    - Therapy that aims at shifting how we perceive something
    - Providing new experiences, reframing experiences and replacing irrational thinking
    - Ex: Use improvising together to shift a belief that whenever I try something new, I'm going to fail
        - Improvising is something new, and trying something together with no actual sense of mistakes existing
        - Provide open space to explore and create without judgement or any opportunity to fail
- **Psychotherapy Approach** (Also known as Psychodynamic)
    - Based on "Psychodynamic Theory", brought forward by Sigmund Freud in 1890-1920, then built upon by Jung, Adler
        - Based upon the belief that human behavior is strongly influenced by unconscious psychological processes, such as internal conflicts, impulses, desires and motives, of which we are largely unaware on a conscious level
    - Focus on explaining motices on why people think/feel/behave as they do, bringing a client insight and/or awareness of unconscious conflicts in order to change negative behaviors and develop more adaptive and positive behaviors and relationships
    - Ex: Improvising and songwriting, brainstorming different words that come to mind (free association, connection to unconscious)
        - Song would often reveal something form the unconsciousness of the client, a way to bring it to the consciousness and have insight into ones own behaviors and unconscious conflicts
        - Can then choose to make change for more positive behaviors and relationships, resulting in greater life satisfaction
- **Biomedical Models**
    - Music therapists also collaborate with physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and other health-care providers to treat/ameliorate the physical, biological, or neurological aspects of a disease/condition
        - Mostly seen in pain management and treating symptoms of mental illness
    1. Focus on the neurobiological foundations of the human nervous system
    2. Strong emphasis on music perception and active music participation as a form of stimulation that activates physiological and neurophysiological processes in the body (which include affect and cognition as part of neural behavior)
    3. Belief that the unique structural and cultural properties of music can be harnessed to access brain and behavior functions to facilitate and to promote healing and rehabilitation
- **Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT)**
    - The therapeutic application of music to cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunctions due to neurologic disease of the human nervous system
        - A **standardized**, evidence-based approach and the outcomes are actually measurable
            - Standardized states that it is implemented the same way regardless of the therapist
            - Example of measurements could be through walking therapy video example (Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation), seeing increase in step rhythm (bpm), length of steps, etc.
    - Three main domains are 
        1. Sensorimotor rehabilitation
        2. Speech/language rehabilitation
        3. Cognitive rehabilitation
    - This would be learned as post-music therapy training
        - Also available to those outside of music therapy, but necessary to be able to play an instrument
- **Eclectic Model**
    - The MTA uses the model(s) felt to best benefit the client, within the MTA's scope of practice/training/ability
        - If not trained in a given model but they feel like it would be the best, they should **not** use that model
        - Only focus on the MTA's ability and training to make a choice of models, and choose the model best for the client
    - Humanistic/client centered approach, since therapist follows the lead of the client to form the model
        - At times of the session, a behavioral approach may be needed, but later a psychotherapy approach may be needed, etc.
- There are many other MT approaches that are not covered here
    - Purpose here is a brief overview to be aware of the many ways a MTA may work with clients
    - Many outside factors may influence the approach
    - Prof's training was in psychodynamic approach, but over time has brought in other aspects like CBT, behavior therapy, etc.
        - Essentially working with a eclectic model now
- Also **Community music therapy** as an approach, but will be covered in Week 9
