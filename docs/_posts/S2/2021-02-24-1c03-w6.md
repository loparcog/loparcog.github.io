Module 9: Precipitation and Acid Rain
===

Precipitation
- **Precipitation** is any form of water that falls from a cloud and reaches the ground
    - Liquid or solid water crystals from the atmosphere to the ground surface
- Driven by same process driving cloud formation
    - Process may start quickly, for example, through convective heating and dissipation
    - However, most precipitation is formed through **accretion**, and many times rain begins as ice
- **Warm Clouds** have an overall temperature profile greater than 0 degrees celsius
    - Their formation begins when saturated air rises rapidly. As it rises, it cools, which forces condensation and creates droplets of water in the cloud
    - As more condensation is added, the drops grow until they reach a diameter of 50-100 micrometers ($\mu m$)
    - The droplets are carried aloft in the rising cloud, colliding and coalescing with each other, building up drops that are about **1000-5000 micrometers, the size of raindrops**
    - As the drops grow in size, their weight increases until it overcomes the upward force of the rising air and they start to fall down
    - As they descend, they become unstable and break into smaller drops
- As a cloud droplet falls, air resistance slows it down
    - The amount of air resistance depends on the size of the drop and on its rate of falling, where the greater the speed, the more air molecules the drop encounters
    - Each second the speed of the falling drop increases until the air resistance equals the pull of gravity, when the drop then falls at a constant speed called **terminal velocity**
    - Larger drops fall faster than smaller ones due to their smaller ratio of surface area to weight
- In a cloud composed only of small cloud droplets of uniform size, the droplets are less likely to collide as they all fall very slowly and at about the same speed
    - Those that do collide usually do not coalesce
- In a cloud composed of different size droplets, larger droplets fall faster than smaller droplets
    - Tiny droplets collect on the larger droplet's forward edge, while others captured in the wake of the larger droplet coalesce on the droplets backside
- In **Cold Clouds** where the temperature is less than 0 degrees celsius, ice crystals form and grow instead
    - They may form by deposition or by freezing supercooled water
    - Water molecules evaporate from supercooled liquid water droplets, thereby decreasing their size
    - These evaporated water molecules are then deposited on ice crystals, giving them their lattice shape and causing them to grow
    - Eventually, the supercooled drops have completely disappeared, leaving behind only ice crystals
    - If the crystals become large enough, they can fall from the cloud as snow
- **Cool Clouds** have temperatures above 0 degree celsius in the lower range of the cloud and subfreezing conditions in the higher range
    - Clouds may be composed of liquid water, supercooled water, and/or ice
    - The coexistence of ice and supercooled water is critical to the creation of cool cloud precipitation, also known as the bergeron process
- The **Bergeron Process** was named after the Swedish meteorologist Tor Bergeron, who proposed that essentially all raindrops began as ice crystals
    - The ice crystal process of rain formation is extremely important in the middle and high latitudes, where clouds extend upward into regions where the air temperature is well below freezing after condensation
    - The greater number of water vapour molecules around a liquid droplet causes the water molecules to diffuse from the liquid droplet toward the ice crystal
    - The ice crystal absorbs the water vapour and grows larger while the water droplet shrinks
- Ice crystals grow through **Accretion**, where falling ice crystals may freeze supercooled water droplets on contact and produce large ice particles
- **Aggregation**, on the other hand, is the process of ice crystals colliding and sticking together with one another
    - Then end product of this clumping is a snowflake
- Overall, the type and abundance of precipitation varies worldwide
    - The tropics only experience rainfall at higher latitudes
    - The precipitation depends on the temperature profile

The Cryosphere
- **The Cryosphere** is the portion of Earth where natural materials such as water and soils occur in frozen form
    - Includes snow, ice in the sea, ice on land, ice sheets (such as Greenland), mountain glaciers and ice caps, as well as frozen ground, river, and lake ice
- **Permafrost** is ground in which the temperature is less than 0 degrees celsius for two or more consecutive years
    - It underlies 25% of Earth's land surface and 50% of Canada's land surface
    - Can be found in different forms:
        - **Pingos** are bodies of more or less pure ice, and exist mainly in the upper part of the ground
        - **Reticulated Ice** is structure forming ice, which bonds sediments together
- The **Snow Line** is the point above which snow and ice cover the ground throughout the year
    - The combination of altitude and latitude affects the precise placement of the snow line at a particular location
    - The snow line is at a much lower altitude near the poles compared to the lower latitudes
- The determining factors for the pattern of snow cover include the timing, which covers the maximum depth, the timing of the melt, the onset of snow accumulation and the length of the season, the magnitude, or how much snow falls, and the rate of the snowfall, or how concentrated in time it is
    - Snow covers deeper at lower latitudes for a shorter period of time during the year, whereas locations at higher latitudes have a shallow cover over many months
- The **Snowpack** ranges from fresh snow to decaying snow
    - It starts as fresh, dry snow that evolves to a mature, settled snowpack and eventually decays
    - Overtime, the snowpack changes; the snow loses its leafy shape, the void spaces in the pack decrease, density increases where snow becomes more compact, and the color of the snow changes from white to gray as it becomes ice

Acid Rain
- **Acidification** is the increase in concentration of hydrogen ions in water and/or soil
    - Can occur through wet deposition, where precipitation of assets to the ground is in the form of rain, snow, fog, or mist
    - The acid water then flows over and through the ground and affects a variety of plants and animals
    - It can also occur through dry deposition, or "atmospheric fallout", where acidic chemicals become incorporated into dust/smoke
- The level of acidification is measured using the pH scale, which is a logarithmic expression of the concentration of hydrogen atoms
    - High concentrations of hydrogen ions are represented by low pH values, while low concentrations are represented by high pH values
- Acids may be neutralized by non-basic compounds called **buffers**
    - Eg. calcium carbonate reacts with hydrogen ions to produce water, carbon dioxide, and calcium ions
    - Reactions like this help to maintain pH close to normal in environments subject to acidification
- Patterns of wet deposition vary between regions and over time
    - Eg. the sulfate deposits in North America, reduced over time reflecting the tougher emission standards in the US
    - Also depends upon sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission patterns, the location of the source, the distance from the source, the degree of oxidation, the predominant wind direction, and the amount of acid neutralizing dust in the atmosphere
- Dry deposition occurs between precipitation events
    - Depends on the uptake of gases by vegetation, the gravitational settling of large particles, and the filtering of particles by vegetation
    - When water is added to the dust, which is settled, it generates acidity in the system
    - Sampling systems are set up with air filters to collect dust from the atmosphere and measure air quality
        - Some dust in North America comes from as far away as China
- Acid precipitation has multiple impacts on the ecosystem
    - A notable effect in terrestrial ecosystems is the decrease in plant growth
    - Surface waters are impacted by stream snowmelt, which generates an **acid shock**
        - Particularly a problem for lakes sitting on the Canadian Shield, as they have little buffering capacity
        - Leads to a reduction in the number of species and freshwater organisms that can survive in an area as it affects they physiology and changes foodweb dynamics
    - Winds carrying acidic moisture can also kill vegetation from exposure
- The loss of biodiversity in aquatic environments is most prevalent in environments with low **acid neutralizing capacity (ANC)**, meaning they have a low buffering potential
    - The loss of species of fish, benthic organisms that live in lake sediments, and zoo plankton is particularly pronounced once pH values are below 5
- Acidic fallout can also lead to damage to man made structures
