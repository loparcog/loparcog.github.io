Music Therapy and Mental Health
===

What is Mental Health?
- There is no health without mental health
- The definition of health by WHO:  
    *" Health is a state of **complete physical, mental, and social well-being** and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity*
    - Mental health is an integral part of this definition!
- Mental health can be conceptualized as a state of well-being in which the individual...
    - Realizes his or her own abilities
    - Can cope with the normal stresses of life
    - Can work productively and fruitfully
    - Is able to make a contribution to their community

Mental Health vs Mental Illness
- Is there a difference?
    - **Yes**, illness has a diagnosis, whereas health is something everyone needs to manage like how everyone needs to manage their physical health with or without a diagnosis

Aspects to Gain Support for Mental Health
- Two main divisions
    1. Looking for therapy/support for **proactive** help
    2. Looking for therapy/support for **crisis management** help
- In all cases, in order for therapy to be successful and most beneficial, the client...
    - Needs to commit to experience results (eg. when quitting smoking, if you join a group to help not for yourself but for someone else who has told you to join to quit smoking, you're not there because you want to quit smoking, so the likelihood of the therapeutic treatment being successful is less than if the motivation came from yourself)
        - Have weekly/regular sessions
        - Ability to reflect verbally/musically
        - Articulate goals or have an opinion on suggested goals
        - Have a desire to enter an alliance to reach goals

Is one MT Approach Better than Another in Mental Health?
- Depends on the client, setting, and reason for referral
    - What are the goals? Group or individual? Age?
- Can draw from aspects of improvisation, one of the psychodynamic models, etc.
    - Not usual but can also see things through Nordoff-Robins
- Mental health goals could include...
    - Enhancing self expression
    - Socializing with others
    - Self reflection
    - Managing symptoms of depression
    - Motivation

In-Class Article
- Purpose to see if music therapy was as effective as treatment as usual when working with inpatient clients to support them in self-expression, building relationships, and improving general motivation
- 144 inpatient participants, adults in mental health care with low motivation for therapt
    - Randomly assigned Music therapy or TAU
        - 72 impatient participants receiving MT bi-weekly for 3 months
        - Other 72 receiving TAU for 3 months
- All impatients received follow-ups at 1, 3, and 9 months respectively
- Study conducted in Australia, Austria, and Norway
- In the individual music therapy sessions...
    - 45 minute MT sessions 2x a week for 3 months
    - 10 different music therapists provided individual sessions
        - Using different therapist didn't seem to affect outcomes
    - Flexible MT manual developed for the study, ensure the MT was best fitted to the needs of the client
- Music Therapy approach was **Resource-Oriented MT**
    - "The client's resources, strengths, and potentials, more than problems and symptoms, should be emphasized, as well as collaboration and equal relationships"
- In the MT manual...
    - Focus on client's strengths and potential
    - Collaborating with client
    - Music improvisation
    - Creating songs
    - Playing pre-composed music
    - Listening to music
    - Reflecting verbally on music and musical interplay
    - Flexible changes based on client's needs
- What is "Treatment as Usual" (TAU)?
    - Medication (antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood stabilizers, psychotropic drugs)
    - Psychotherapy or psychological treatment
    - Electroconvulsive therapy
    - Counselling/OT, PT, gardening, SW
        - Didn't use all of these, put together options to best support the client
- Outcomes of the Study (Measurement scales and practices)
    - Primary: Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)
    - Secondary: General Symptoms BSI-18 (Anxiety, depression, somatic complaints)  
    Interest in Music Scale (IiM)  
    Motivation for Change - URICA subscales  
    Vitality, Social Relationships, etc.
- Results
    - MT effective for mental health care impatient clients with low motivation
    - Most primary and secondary measures indicate a significant difference between MT and TAU
    - Drop out rate less for MT vs TAU (shows engagement which is important, even over the successfulness of the treatment)
        - If you're not engaged you're not gonna get anything out of it
        - Also, it's difficult to *passively engage* in a music therapy session, which helps overall engagement
