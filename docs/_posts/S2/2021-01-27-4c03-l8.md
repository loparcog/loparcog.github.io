Cookies
===

Cookies
- HTTP itself is stateless, but it is often desirable to identify users
    - Restriction, customizing content, etc
- **Cookies**: HTTP messages **carry** state
- There are four components:
    1. Cookie header line of HTTP response message
    2. Cookie header line in next HTTP request message
    3. Cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser
    4. Backend database at website
- Example: Susan always accesses internet from PC
    - Visited eBay before and visits Amazon for the first time
    - When initial HTTP requests arrives at site, site creates:
        - Unique ID (different than eBay, managed by Amazon)
        - Entry in backend database for ID
    - Response message returns ID in form of cookie, storing it locally in the browser
    - Any new requests to Amazon will use the cookie stored to get the user ID, and populate the site with session-specific content
- Cookies can be used for...
    - Authorization
    - Shopping carts
    - Recommendations
    - User session state
- Can be issues with privacy, however
    - Cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you
    - Third-party cookies can track users across multiple sites (eg. Google AdSense)
        - Do not need to be visible ads or anything, can be invisible cookies

Domain Name System (DNS)
- People use **hostname** for things (eg. first names, identifiers)
    - Not as easy to process from network perspective, routers like working with numbers and IPs
    - Need to translate things like `mcmaster.ca` to their respective host and IP
- Hosts, routers use IP address for addressing datagrams
    - How to map between IP address and hostname?
- Hostname to IP Address Translation
    - Host/server aliasing: Can have different canonical vs alias names (eg. `mcmaster.ca` is an alias to the canonical `pinwps02.uts.mcmaster.ca`, found through traceroute)
    - Load distribution: Replicated web servers, using a set of IP addresses for one canonical name (eg. `google.com` could be seen through traceroute to use multiple IPs)
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**
    - Distributed database implemented in hierarchy of many name servers
    - Application-layer protocol
        - Address/name translation
- Why not centralize DNS?
    - Would make single point of failure
    - Create high traffic volume
    - Latency to access distant centralized database
    - Maintenance (doesn't scale)
- Distributed, hierarchical database model

    - There are also local DNS servers, not part of the hierarchy but exists
- DNS: Root name servers
    - 13 logical servers in total
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/rns.PNG)
    - Contacted by local name server that can not resolve name
    - Root name server
        - Contacts authoritative name server for the appropriate domains if name mapping not known
        - Gets and returns mapping
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**: Responsible for com, org, net, edu, etc., and all top-level country domains such as ca, uk, fr, etc.
- **Authoritative DNS Servers**: Organization's DNS servers, providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization's servers (eg. web and mail)
    - Can be maintained by organization or service provider
- **Local Name Server**
    - Does not strictly belong to hierarchy
    - Each ISP (residential ISP, company, university) has one
        - Also called "default name server"
    - When a host makes a DNS query, query is sent to its local DNS server
        - Acts as a **proxy**, forwards query into hierarchy
- Once (any) name server learns a mapping, it **caches** the mapping
    - Cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time
    - TLD servers typically cached in local name servers
        - Thus root name servers not often visited
    - Update/notify mechanisms under design by IETF, RFC 2136
- Two types of queries to resolve the host name
    1. **Recursive Queries**: Ask a server to get an answer for you. If the server does not have the answer, send the query to the next server in the chain, continually going until you get to the server with the answer
        - Starts on local DNS server, then goes to root, then TLD DNS, finally ending up at authoritative
    2. **Iterative Queries**: Instead of chaining servers, check your local DNS server, and then from your local DNS server, go out to each other server (root, TLD, authoritative), getting the address for each new sever from the last one
        - Same idea, but no more chain, shallow comms all done directly from local DNS server
        - Need to follow same path of root to TLD to authoritative since each prior server gives the path to the next server
- You can get a DNS message example using the command line tool `dig`
    - This command acts recursively by default
