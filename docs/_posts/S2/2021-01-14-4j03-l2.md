Modulation and Source Coding
===

Communication: What Happens from Sender to Receiver?
- **Encoding** is the process of putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, some symbols) into a specialized format for either *efficient* or *reliable* transmission  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/enc.PNG)
- The **source encoder** tries to achieve the efficient use of lossless channel (eg. Huffman code)
    - Example are things like phone number area codes, making more efficiency when dialing someone's number (more populated have smaller area codes to reduce data needed to be transmitted)
- The **channel encoder** adds redundancy to the transmitted signal, so errors caused by noise during transmission can be corrected at the receiver

Huffman Coding
- Huffman codes can be used to compress information (like what is used in JPEGs)
- The basic idea is that instead of storing each character in a file as an 8-bit ASCII value, we will instead store the more frequently occurring characters using fewer bits and less frequently occurring characters using more bits
    - On average it should half the file size
- As an example, we can take a string and separate all the characters into their own bubble (including spaces) sorted by frequency
- Next, we can use a greedy algorithm to build up a Huffman Tree
    - Lowest on the left, highest on the right when combining trees
    - Take two smallest values and add them (prioritize singles over trees, leave any leftover singles for end tree)
- We then pick the nodes with the smallest frequency and combine them together to form a new node (Greedy alg is used to select nodes)
- The two selected nodes are combined to form a new node. This continues until we only have 1 node left in the set

- Once this is done, we can assign codes to the tree by placing a 0 on every left branch and a 1 on every right branch
    - A traversal of the tree from root to leaf gives the Huffman code for that particular leaf character
    - Note that **no code is the prefix of another code**
- With the image above, *e* would be 00, *d* would be 010, *u* would be 011, and so on
- These codes are then used to encode the string

Channel Coding
- **Repetition Coding**: Redundant bits are sent to reduce errors, sending them multiple times so the receiver can decode using the majority repetitions (need at least 2/3 to be sent successfully)
- Given the channel error rate (**crossover possibility**) is $p = 0.01$, the probability of a transmission error would then be:  
    $$P_e = \binom32 p^2 (1-p) + p^3 = 0.0003$$
- **Channel Coding** sacrifices efficiency to achieve correctness
    - More error detection codes will be introduced later
- **Modulation** is a process of conveying message signals (digital or analog) inside another signal that can be physically transmitted
    - Digital Baseband Modulation: Method to transfer a digital bit stream over a baseband channel using a pulse train (different signal levels), usually used for a wired local area network
    - Passband Signal Modulation: Message is modulated onto a moderate to high frequency range passband signal

Digital Baseband Modulation
- Common binary voltage encodings (digital to digital translation) include the following:
    - **Non-Return to Zero (NRZ)**: Turns signal into data by translating high values to 1 and low values to 0, creating a long string of bit values
        - This long string of 1s and 0s causes baseline wander, however
        - There is also a problem in clock recovery, the receiver needs to se the clock to match the senders or else they can receive too many or too few bits, or bits in the wrong order
            ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/csync.png)
        - Ex: In a digital transmission, the receiver clock is 0.1% faster than the sender clock. How many extra bits per second does the receiver receive if the data rate is 1kbps? What about 1Mbps?
            - At 1kbps, the receiver receives 1001 bits instead of 1000 bps
            - At 1Mbps, the receiver receives 1001000 bps instead of 1000000
    - **NRZ Inverted (NRZI)**: Works by turning a holding signal into 0s and transition signals into 1s
        - Solves the issue for series of 1s but not for 0s
    - **Manchester (used by IEEE 802.3)**: Uses XOR NRZ data with thew clock, solving clock recovery problem but only 50% efficient (1/2 bit per transition)
    - **4B/5B**: Encode every 4 consecutive bits as a 5-bit code
        - This 5-bit code never has more than 2 consecutive 0's (only special characters outside of hexadecimal have 3 consecutive 0's), at most 1 leading 0, and at most 2 trailing 0s
        - Transmitted with NRZI, 80% efficient
        - Standardized table for this

Bandpass Signal Modulation
- In signal transmission, the information-bearing signal with a waveform pass through a transmisson medium (channel)
    - Modulation is the step to assign a suitable waveform
- **Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)**: A type of amplification modulation  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ask.png)
- **Multiple Amplitude Shift Keying (MASK)**: Done to modify multiple amplitude levels  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/mask.png)
- **Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)**: One frequency encodes a 0 while another frequency encodes a 1 (a form of frequency modulation)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/fsk.PNG)
- **Multiple Frequency Shift Keying (MFSK)**: More than two frequencies are used  
    $$s_i(t) = A \cos(2 \pi f_i t), 1 \leq i \leq M$$
    - $f_i = f_c + (2i - 1 - M) f_d$
    - $f_c$: The carrier frequency
    - $f_d$: The difference frequency
    - $M$: number of different signal elements = $2^r$
    - $r$: Number of bits per signal element
- Example shown below  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/mfsk.png)
- **Phase Shift Keying (PSK)**: Binary, Quad, or *M*
    - Binary PSK (BPSK) 
        0: Same phase as last signal element
        1: 180Â° shift from last signal element
    - Four Level (QPSK)  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/qpsk.PNG)  
    An example can be seen here:
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/qpsk2.PNG)  
    - *M*-ary PSK (MPSK): A modulation where data bits select one of *M* phase shifted versions of the carrier to transmit the data. The *M* possible waveforms all have the same amplitude and frequency but different phases
    - Defined as:  
        $$s_i(t) = A \cos(2 \pi f_c t + \theta_i), 0 \lt t \lt T, i = 1, 2, ..., M$$  
        where $M = 2^n$ and $\theta_i = \frac{(2i - 1)\pi}{M}$
- These can all be observed in the following constellation diagram:
