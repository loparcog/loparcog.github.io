Midterm Notes
===

Overview
- All content from Week 1-6
- 65 MT Q's in 60min
- Not "meant" to be open book, thus the small time limit

Week 1: Intro
===

What is Music Therapy?
- A discipline in which a credentialed music therapy professional uses music purposefully within therapeutic relationships to support development, health, and well-being
    - Music therapists use music safely and ethically to address human needs within cognitive, communicative, emotional, musical, social, and spiritual domains
- **Canadian Association of Music Therapists (CAMT)** estaiblished in 1974, federal body, self-regulated and non-profit organization
    - Other non-regulated groups exist
- Need to get a bachelor/masters in music therapy to be recognized as a **Music Therapist Accreddited (MTA)**
    - Studies things like music as well as physiology, anatomy, biology, etc.
    - After 1000h internship and education, a **Certification Board of Music Therapists (CBMT)** examination needs to be taken, and needs to renew this in 5 year cycles
- Personal qualifications require abilities from both musical and therapeutic distributions
    - Musical requires not only strong musical knowledge, but improv knowledge and ability as well
    - Therapist requires good physical/emotional stability, interest in helping others, patience and understanding, general therapist things
- Some MTA's use the act of Psychotherapy, working under the **College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO)**, only applies to music therapists working in Ontario
- MTA works among all ages and diagnosis, something universally and long understood
- MTA's can be found in a variety of places like hospitals, clinics, group homes, prisons, private practices, etc.
- A session usually has three parts, will go more into depth later
    1. Hello / Greeting Song
    2. Music Therapy Interventions
    3. Goodbye Song
- Music therapy interventions can use one or many of the following:
    - Pre-composed music: Trying to evoke strong memories commonly which we may see and feel in those moments of time (not always positive memories)
    - Listening: Helps to develop cognitive skills like attention and memory, provide a sense of the familiar
    - Singing: Assists in development of articulation, rhythm, and breath control
    - Improvisation: Creative, non-verbal means of expression, easily approached and requires no previous musical training, helping to fill the void where words fail
    - Lyric analysis: Helps someone to find how to articulate their feelings and emotions, express themselves with pre-existing lyrics
    - Song writing: Facilitate self-expression, give structure to how someone is feeling
- Like other therapy types, it can be individual or groups, with or without parents
- Music used since it is a universal phenomenon (not necessarily language), accessible to all ages and cultural backgrounds
    - Is also flexible, can be used in many different environments
    - Can be used passively and actively
- Music therapy is **NOT**:
    - Something that requires the patient to have a musical background for
    - Entertainment, not playing live/recorded music or engaging in music as a hobby
    - Instrument/singing lessons
    - Special music education to teach special learners about music
- Process to receive music therapy
    - Referral (can be made by anyone, not just for a diagnosis or past music history, for a specific case of condition of the patient to try to solve)
    - Assessment (Can take place over one session, several, or ongoing, depending on case)
    - Goals (Based on assessment)
    - Treatment Plan (interventions, using one/many intervention types above)
    - Reports and re-assignments

Week 2: History of Music in Health and Music Therapy
===

History of Music
- Played parts in ancient civilization
    - Basic instruments found among old artifacts
- Today we have music wherever we go, but this was not always the case
    - Played many more roles than enjoyment, also for things like communications
    - Markings in cave marked best acoustic points to communicate
- **Preliterate Cultures**: Complex language, but no symbol system for written communication, therefore what we know about music during this time is *speculative*
    - Music was a supernatural force that affected mental and physical wellbeing
    - Music and medicine was almost interchangeable
    - "Medicine-men" performed healing rituals to appease Gods
    - Something not just for the elite, but encouraged for everyone to take part in, especially for religion and health
    - Those who could play music well were highly praised
- **Early Civilizations**: 5000-6000yrs BC
    - Music played an important part in rational medicine, and an important role in magic and religious healing ceremonies
    - Egyptian priest-physicians referred to music as medicine for the soul and often included chant therapies as part of medical practice
- **Ancient Greece**: 600 BC
    - Music had force over thought, emotion, and physical health
    - Healing shrines and temples had hymn specialists and music was prescribed to the mentally disturbed
    - Emotional catharsis
    - Aristotle recognized emotional catharsis, and Plato wrote about medicine for the soul
    - Very heavily used in many facets of life, dealt with through the fates and such
    - Views on what music was "good" or "bad", something still sorta done today
        - Need to avoid this in music therapy, no real prescriptive ability for everyone, it will be specific for each person and their medical goals
    - Hippocratic Oath still swears by Apollo
        - Fun fact, Apollo was also the god of music and poetry along with healing, showing music still plays a role in the medical world
- **The Middle Ages**: 476-1450 AD
    - Medicine now influenced by the 4 cardinal humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile)
    - Boethius claimed that music had the power to degrade/improve human morals
    - Saint Basil believed it to be a positive vehicle for sacred emotion
    - Hymns were considered effective against certain unspecified respiratory diseases
- **The Renaissance**: 1300-1600 AD
    - Advances in anatomy, physiology and clinical medicine marked the beginning of the scientific approach to medicine
    - Treatment of diseases still based on 4 humors
    - Physicians prescribed music as a *preventative* medicine
    - Many epidemics occurred during this time, music was considered a powerful tool to improve emotional health
        - See writings by Zarlino (musician) and Vesalius (physician)
- **The Baroque Period**: 1580-1750 AD
    - Medicine continued to be informed by the four humors
    - Kircher (use of music for disease) - matching music to personality characteristics
    - Burton (The Anatomy of Melancholy) - music for treatment of depression
    - Louis Roger, physician in 1748, wrote a book on the effects of music on the human body
- First publication most related to music therapy from 1789, unknown author, "Music Physically Considered" in Columbian magazine
    - Discusses principles currently applied in MT (ie. importance of a trained practitioner)
- **19th Century**
    - Many articles in music and medical journals for music treating physical and mental health
    - 1832 - Music programs in schools for the blind/with disabilities
    - Research and practices growing in this period
- **20th Century**
    - WW2 solders were not responding to medical care for mental well being (no term for PTSD yet), but music was used for wellness to get past this
        - Went into Soldier Project Research to research using music for health care goals
    - Resulted in first music therapy training program at Michigan State University in 1944
    - 1950 saw the creation of the **National Association of Music Therapy (NAMT)**, first association to regulate the profession of music therapy
        - Started to spread across the world, Cellist worked with people with Autism in England, working into government recognition and training programs from 1958 (BSMT created) - 1976 (British government recognized Association of Professional Music Therapy, now known as BAMT)
        - Spread across central and eastern Europe in the 1970's, and further countries done by 2005

History of Music Therapy in Canada (1970's)
- Early 1970s - Norma Sharpe (music therapist (by her own word not actually trained or anything) working in St. Thomas, ON) had regular contact with individuals and organizations across Canada who shared an interest in MT
    - Sharpe presided over first music therapy conference at St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital in St. Thomas, ON
- Mid 1970s - Conferences held to unify those working in the field of music therapy throughout Canada
    - Conferences could be used to share techniques, programs and assessment of rehabilitative effectiveness
    - Led to the formation of a national association for music therapy in Canada named **Canada Music Therapy Association in 1974**
    - First training program also started in 1974 in Capilano University, BC
- Today - Now known as Canadian Association of Music Therapists (CAMT), but also need to be recognized by the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO) today
    - First MT professional development academy in Canada launched in 2017 (founded by prof, huh)

Music Therapy Globally
- Music therapy is worldwide, moving to the World Federation of Music Therapy being developed in 1985
    - Also launched open access international journal called *Voices*

Example in Lecture
- Video of using music to play in hospitals to reduce need for painkillers to be used
    - Actually not music therapy since there is no actual music therapist involved in the project (no guidance/informing either)
    - This IS an example, however, of how music can be therapeutic and helpful, how one can think about using music meaningfully
    - Also, all controlled by musician/doctors, no input from the patients
        - A lot of assumption that they are/aren't liking it, a little fucked
        - Could invoke negative memories or feelings, something that a music therapist needs to be concious of
- This would be an example of **music medicine**, but not music therapy
- Music therapy is informed by music educators and physicians/nurses, working with music and education cognition
    - Example would be the alphabet, most likely everyone learned through song, along with many common early childhood lessons
    - Not so much later on because western culture does not like singing past ages 8-9, ashamed of bad singing or nervous on self singing
        - Example of why this is stupid is Happy Birthday, everyone goes for that regardless on "singing ability"
    
Week 3: Music Therapy Approaches
===

Approaches
- NOTE: The terms "approach" and "model" will be used interchangeably for this course
- Do all music therapists use the same approach?
    - **No**, there are many approaches, trainings, addition trainings, etc.
    - Setting and client group can influence approach
    - Each country/health care system has different influence
    - Government/economic demands
    - Societal pressures (Evidence based practice (EBP), funding)
    - Advances in research (fMRI, EEG)
- Is one approach better than another
    - Questions should be asked to determine the best approach:
        - What is the training and strengths of the therapist?
        - What are the needs of the client?
    - More than one approach can answer these questions as well, does not need to be one specific answer
- What is the role of music
    - **Music *AS* therapy**: Some approaches focus on the music. It is the music itself that facilitates change
    - **Music *IN* therapy**: Some approaches utilize music as a tool to facilitate change
- **Creative Music Therapy** (also referred to as **Nordoff-Robbins** music therapy)
    - 1959-76: Paul Nordoff (American composer) and Clive Robbins (British special educator) believed that music did the therapy
    - Did not depend on a specific diagnosis, originally focussed on children with disabilities but has spread out
        - Identify a healthy "music-child" within each person, and this could be reached by playing with the client
    - **Music-centered** - not focused on verbal
        - Not always, can be adjusted by people using the model, but typically music-centered 
    - One individual would be making music with client, the other would be on the piano creating music "in the moment" to support the client's creativity
        - Piano music is "connecting with the music child in the person", who for example may be on the drum
    - Can be constrained due to cost (having 2 music therapists at once is costly)
    - Need specific training from accredited Nordoff-Robbins training programs to truly operate with this
        - Others may bring elements of this model in their work, but do not have the proper training to actualy do it
    - Example of music AS therapy
- **Guided Imagery Method (GIM)**
    - Post MTA training (3yrs)
    - Helen Bonney
    - Listen to pre-recorded music (classical) and create discussion around images that come to forefront after listening to image
        - Done in 1970s, currently when music replace clinical use of LSD was being tested
        - Looking into music to replace hallucinogenics
    - Activates "inner-reflection"
        - Images can be mental, visual, using any range of senses
        - Encourage clients to discuss and draw visuals that come to mind
    - Example of music IN therapy
- **Behavioral Approach**
    - The use of music as a contingent reinforcement or stimulus cue to increase/modify behavior
    - Result-driven and therapist-led
    - Ex: NICU infants using stimulus of music listening to suck for nutrition
        - When a child sucks on a pacifier, music would be played as positive reinforcement, increasing sucking behavior
        - Negative stimuli would then be the lack of music that occurs when they stop sucking
- **Cognitive Behavioral Model (CBT)**
    - Therapy that aims at shifting how we perceive something
    - Providing new experiences, reframing experiences and replacing irrational thinking
    - Ex: Use improvising together to shift a belief that whenever I try something new, I'm going to fail
        - Improvising is something new, and trying something together with no actual sense of mistakes existing
        - Provide open space to explore and create without judgement or any opportunity to fail
- **Psychotherapy Approach** (Also known as Psychodynamic)
    - Based on "Psychodynamic Theory", brought forward by Sigmund Freud in 1890-1920, then built upon by Jung, Adler
        - Based upon the belief that human behavior is strongly influenced by unconscious psychological processes, such as internal conflicts, impulses, desires and motives, of which we are largely unaware on a conscious level
    - Focus on explaining motices on why people think/feel/behave as they do, bringing a client insight and/or awareness of unconscious conflicts in order to change negative behaviors and develop more adaptive and positive behaviors and relationships
    - Ex: Improvising and songwriting, brainstorming different words that come to mind (free association, connection to unconscious)
        - Song would often reveal something form the unconsciousness of the client, a way to bring it to the consciousness and have insight into ones own behaviors and unconscious conflicts
        - Can then choose to make change for more positive behaviors and relationships, resulting in greater life satisfaction
- **Biomedical Models**
    - Music therapists also collaborate with physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and other health-care providers to treat/ameliorate the physical, biological, or neurological aspects of a disease/condition
        - Mostly seen in pain management and treating symptoms of mental illness
    1. Focus on the neurobiological foundations of the human nervous system
    2. Strong emphasis on music perception and active music participation as a form of stimulation that activates physiological and neurophysiological processes in the body (which include affect and cognition as part of neural behavior)
    3. Belief that the unique structural and cultural properties of music can be harnessed to access brain and behavior functions to facilitate and to promote healing and rehabilitation
- **Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT)**
    - The therapeutic application of music to cognitive, sensory, and motor dysfunctions due to neurologic disease of the human nervous system
        - A **standardized**, evidence-based approach and the outcomes are actually measurable
            - Standardized states that it is implemented the same way regardless of the therapist
            - Example of measurements could be through walking therapy video example (Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation), seeing increase in step rhythm (bpm), length of steps, etc.
    - Three main domains are 
        1. Sensorimotor rehabilitation
        2. Speech/language rehabilitation
        3. Cognitive rehabilitation
    - This would be learned as post-music therapy training
        - Also available to those outside of music therapy, but necessary to be able to play an instrument
- **Eclectic Model**
    - The MTA uses the model(s) felt to best benefit the client, within the MTA's scope of practice/training/ability
        - If not trained in a given model but they feel like it would be the best, they should **not** use that model
        - Only focus on the MTA's ability and training to make a choice of models, and choose the model best for the client
    - Humanistic/client centered approach, since therapist follows the lead of the client to form the model
        - At times of the session, a behavioral approach may be needed, but later a psychotherapy approach may be needed, etc.
- There are many other MT approaches that are not covered here
    - Purpose here is a brief overview to be aware of the many ways a MTA may work with clients
    - Many outside factors may influence the approach
    - Prof's training was in psychodynamic approach, but over time has brought in other aspects like CBT, behavior therapy, etc.
        - Essentially working with a eclectic model now
- Also **Community music therapy** as an approach, but will be covered in Week 9

Week 4: Songwriting as a Music Therapy Intervention
===

Introduction to Song Writing
- Song writing provides a tangible product
    - Does not need any background in music creation/training/theory to take part in song writing
    - Can be a recording or on-paper form, either to share with others or hold onto themselves
- Songs can be used to communicate with loved ones
    - Ease barrier of how to share how someone is feeling
    - May be more palatable for the person receiving
- Reflection - motivation and encouragement
- Safe space-exploration - identifying and externalizing emotions
- Telling your stories

Songwriting as a Music Therapy Intervention
- What client groups might benefit from the intervention of song writing? What might be some reasons for referral?
    - Range of movement issues? Not really applicable for this, may make a song to move to but songwriting is secondhand there
    - Anxiety can use songwriting to facilitate finding what causes the anxiety and tools to cope with the anxiety
    - Group therapy can find benefits in this as well
    - Main goals are in **self-reflection** and **communication**, most often around mental health goals and self awareness
        - Always exceptions though!

Example Video of Song Writing
- Cancer patient named Tim songwriting in music therapy
    - Initially against but eased into the idea of music therapy
    - Helps to get through emotions and struggles of hospital life
- Song writing main music intervention in this video
    - Helpful for emotional journey while going through treatment for cancer
    - Was also instrument playing, possible to do songwriting without playing

Acquired Brain Injury (ABI)
- ABIs are complex injuries with a variety of symptoms and disabilities
- An ABI patient often deals with:
    - Loss
    - Emotional crisis
    - Adjustment
    - Rehabilitation
    - Identity
- Rehabilitation commonly long, change commonly slow
- Often experiences a "change of identity", going from something like an athlete or parent or something, but since whatever happened, they cannot identify themselves as that anymore
- Symptoms include limited ROM (range of motion), dexterity, and speech issues
- For this class, TBI (traumatic brain injury) and ABI will be used interchangeably
- Common themes in ABI song writing are (from study analyzing 82 song written by TBI patients, these were the most common themes, idea of study was to try and learn what the emotional journey was like for people with ABIs)
    - Isolation
    - Dependency
    - Helplessness
    - Body image
    - Anger
- How can ABI affect speech?
    - Aphasia: Cognitively aware of what one wants to say, but cannot find the words
    - Dyspraxia: Difficulty articulating speech
    - Music therapy and speech pathologies
        - Can still sing even with these issues, can sometimes bypass speaking issues

When Should Song Writing be Introduced?
- When will song writing be helpful?
    - Aid in articulation and expression, self-discovery
- Depends on the client
    - Client may not want this, not want to expose emotional vulnerabilities right away
- Tell them about the risks if they want to start right away

Song Writing Techniques
- **Brain Storming**: Thinking about themes and words
- **Fill in the Blanks**: Using a pre-existing song and changing up words
- **Song Parody**: Changing all the words but melody remains the same
- **Song Collage**: Using pieces of other songs and putting them together
- **Rhyming**: Making brainstormed themes and words to rhyme in a song
- Remember end goal is to satisfy the needs of the client, so there doesn't necessarily need to be rhythm or rhyme or anything to it, as long as the client is happy and expressing or finding what they want through the song
    - The music therapist is not there to facilitate the correct music theory, rather facilitate the process of expression through songwriting
- Client will direct the music therapist on how the song should sound (happy/sad tone, any instruments, temp, etc.)

Gracie Video Example
- 12 year old who needed spinal therapy
    - Worked with a music therapist for her mom to write songs for one another while separated since Gracie would need to go across to other hospitals for therapy
- Song writing used here as song parody from "I am woman hear me roar", purpose for mom to empower her daughter who will be going to surgery
    - Very powerful way for her daughter to receive this message
    - Not only hear it from her mom, but also musically supported form the MTA and other health care workers, bringing everyone together
- Looking to empower Gracie and elevate her mood
- Gracie is the recipient of the songwriting, the mom was not necessarily the client but was probably helpful for her as well as another tool to support her kids

Sam Courseware Example
- 19yrs old, brain injury through train injury, not sure but may have been attempting suicide
    - Living at hospital due to care he requires and daily rehab program he is in
    - As a result of the brain injury, his cognitive ability is not helping his insight, so he doesn't understand he needs to be in the hospital to get better
    - Because of this he's angry, he wants to go home, he doesn't want to engage in the rehab options/interventions available to him
    - Non-cooperative to any health care specialists, referred to music therapist to hopefully "reach" him and help him express himself, ultimately understanding himself more and helping others to understand him, hopefully leading him down a path of rehabilitation
    - Sam enjoyed heavy metal music, so music therapist suggested this as the melody which Sam was really engaged in
- Song example, was result of many sessions
    - Chose chords and mood to play the song
- Empowering to share message he wanted to share

Sallie Courseware Example
- 12yrs old, struck by a car
    - Physio and speech issues
    - Language impairments, memory impairments, impaired social judgement
    - Unmotivated to participate in most therapies (therefore referral to MT)
- MT was used here for self-expression
    - Loved the Spice Girls, ideas of song writing were motivating, lots of ideas and creativity
    - Mom assisted in sessions
    - Wanted to create a video recording
    - Asked to write a "going home" song prior to discharge, worked on this during her last sessions (song parody of "Stop Right Now" by Spice Girls)
    - Song spoke about family members, upcoming events, and desire to walk again

Week 5: Music Therapy in Dementia Care and Precomposed Music
===

What is Ageing?
- To date, there exists **no normative** established values of what cognitive impairment or memory loss, or what neurochemical and neurophysiological changes accompany normal ageing
- Complex developmental process that involves the intersection of physical, phycological and social factors
- Older adults is currently the fastest growing population
- There is increased longevity in today's culture, from changing factors like:
    - War (much less so)
    - Tobacco (understanding of health risks and avoidance)
    - Life-styles (more understanding on healthy lifestyle choices)
    - Health care (and therefore increased elder care)

Definitions of Age
- **Chronological Age**: The number of years someone has been living
    - Our familiar way of measuring age
- **Biological Age**: On going *physical* process (birth to death)
    - Wrinkles, gray hairs, loss of stamina, bone density, etc.
- **Psychological Age**
    - Ability to respond to a changing environment and adapt to new situations
    - Learning/emotions (eg. computers, smartphones)
    - Insisting on writing and storing everything on paper
- **Psychosocial Age**: Cultural views and expectations
    - Can depend on what generation someone was brought up in, and how they adjust over time

Example Video: Betty White
- Example on how there are no normative values on ages
    - Psychosocial age is the same as when she was in her 20's, 30's, etc.
    - Biological age has increased semi-regularly, but would you be able to guess age by a picture?
    - Psychological age seems to all be there, still doing movies and such

Portrayal in Western Culture
- Negative portrayal of elderly
- Hide old people in retirement homes/LTCs - they have nothing to contribute
- Booming cosmetic industry, to hide signs of biological ageing
- Non-western cultures hold old people to high regard, looked up to for their wisdom

Music Therapy and Ageing
- All people age differently, we need to take into account all influences
    - Do assessments to see psychosocial age, what their issues might be, etc., to make the proper treatment plan
- Sample video of music therapy in a long term care facility

Dementia Definition
- An acquired decline of cognitive function represented by **memory and language impairment**
    - Just because you're ageing doesn't mean you will have dementia, big difference
- Difficult to diagnose, many different types and diagnoses within this umbrella
    - What is "normal" degeneration vs. an illness like Alzheimer's?
    - Masked by depression (can also cause cognitive and behavioural disorders, depression common in elderly)
    - Estimated that 20-30% will have an accompanying depression
- Main tool to diagnose dementia is the **mini mental state exam (MMSE)**
    - Brief cognitive test (Folstein, Folstein & McHugh 1975)
    - Widely used even today, "gold standard"
    - Results can vary based on education/english second language 

Dementia Symptom Care
- Progressive deterioration
    - No opportunity for rehabilitation
    - Goals should be around managing symptoms and enhancing aspects of well being, essentially give a "relief"
- Music abilities preserved - uses both hemispheres of the brain
- Musicality and singing rarely tested as features of cognitive deterioration
- Listening to story vs music (in reading), one case study with an 81yr old
    - Reduce wandering (stay seated), expanded upon by Groene (1993)
- Attempting music playing can highlight deterioration
    - MT needs to be mindful of clients who were musicians

Dementia and Health Care
- Cost of institutional care in USA over $25 billion/year (Steg 1990)
- Estimates suggest 15% of people over 65yrs will have moderate dementia
- Need for treatment initiatives
- Due to advancements in optical microscope, 1907 (Alzheimer) able to see the neuronal degeneration and senile plaques on the brain - identifying the disease

Dementia
- Common diagnosis associated with ageing (but not a result of ageing)
- Depression also associated with age
- Also deals with Alzheimers and Parkinsons (progressive)

Reasons for Referral
- *Likes music? Good/gifted at music? Responds to music? Was in a chair? Just having dementia?*
- Decrease pacing, agitation, vocalizations
- Increase eye contact, meaningful moments
- Increases alertness, movement
- Evoke positive memories, orientation to the "here and now"
- Transition to facility, lessen confusion, decrease anxiety

Research into Outcomes of MT
- Most published work re: MT and elderly (group MT)
    - Enhance socialization and communication (reduce isolation)
    - Muscular stimulation /fine and gross motor skills
- (1990, Clair) as per reading: 15 months of MT
    - Deterioration continued in all areas
    - Yet still able to participate in music activities
    - Interacted with one another, remain seated
- An example of group MT in LTC is something like "Saints Go Marching In"
    - Its repetitive lyrics makes things easier to process
    - Precomposed music is also good since it has a predictable structure
    - Give some form of "success", for someone who is forgetting many things, being able to get a song down supports them

Pre-composed Music
- Why is it such a powerful tool?
    - Can evoke memories, many life events connected to music
- Class example: listen to a song in class and list memories evoked
    - Evoking not just memories, but also opinions/thoughts

Entertainment vs Music Therapy
- "Isn't this a sing-along?"
    - Staff could walk by and assume a sing-along is taking place, a recreation tool rather than a therapeutic one
- What makes it MT?
- Familiarity/predictable music (ABA) - Que Serra Serra
    - ABA with A being a verse, B being a chorus
- Secure, empowering, reassurance, confidence, memory-evoking
- Stimulate dialogue/relationships (example of italian song and neighbours finding eachother through it in a LTC)

MT Interventions
- Singing
- Improvisation
- Playing instruments (eg. bell choir)
    - Prof explained bell choir seemed off in the beginning, but all in the group get a bell or chime or such, and would adapt to learning the music based on learning abilities and MT aided in keeping things together
    - Would keep people interested and involved, empowering to work together towards performances
    - Could also do activities like pointing to people to play their bells and get people to guess the song being played
        - Also gets a feeling of accomplishment for being able to play this song
        - People knew when it was their turn to come in after some practice
- Song writing

iPod Project
- Not music therapy, but important for understanding music as a tool in health care
    - Not music therapy since no music therapy is needed to facilitate it, no referral/assessment, etc.

Week 6: Improvisation & ASD
===

Improvisation
- What is improvisation?
    - Which model or approach is likely to use improvisation?
    - Why would an MTA implement improvisation?

Free Improvisation and Playing Rules
- Can be intimidating to people with and without music training
    - How to facilitate?
- Number of playing rules to help with this
    - ie. playing only on black keys of the piano (sounds all sound good together, easy form of self expression or exploring improvisation)
- Technique of **Mirroring**
    - Empathetic, doing what the client is doing at the exact same time
        - Same key in some cases for things like one piano
    - Allows the client to see themselves in the therapist
- Technique of **Matching**
    - Empathetic
    - Validates client
    - Therapist creates music that is compatible with the clients (matches)
    - Same style and quality but not the exact same notes, concept of together yet separate
    - More like an accent on top of client, doesn't need to be same time either
- Technique of **Grounding**
    - Creating a musical anchor for the client
        - Done with a repetitive, predictable beat
    - "Ground the chaos", give some type of centeredness while still allowing client to be full in their expression
- Technique of **Holding**
    - Stronger pattern instead of grounding, helps to do some more guidance through chaos
    - Musical anchor and *container* (container is strong patterned music which provides a structure for musical chaos)
- Technique of **Dialoguing**
    - Musical conversation, form responses and make a sort of *back and forth* between therapist and client
- Interplay between all of these techniques can occur in a session
- Many can be involved in improv, just watch for someone who may not be too *grounded*, as the free chaos could further facilitate a disconnection, will need more grounding and holding
    - No background needed, commonly better without since trained musicians have habits to think of keys and natural transitions and such
- Outcomes of improv include
    - Facilitation of social skills and turn taking
    - Facilitate increased attention span
    - Enhance confidence, allow client to take more risks
    - Reduce anxiety

Music Therapy & ASD
- "Everyone is a genius, but if you just a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life thinking its stupid"
    - Many abilities those with autism have that neurotypical people do not
- What is **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**?
    - Autism is a pervasive developmental disability that affects a person's ability to communicate and interact with others
        - Music therapy focusses on strengths, not weaknesses, so like to focus on what makes someone strong other than what breaks them down
    - Seen as a spectrum, going from non-verbal, some with "behaviours", etc.
        - Very different for each person
- Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015
    - In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1-2 per 1000 worldwide
    - In developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD
- Autism is a very complex disorder
    - If you have met one person with autism, that's just it, very unique for each person
    - PDD, Rett's Syndrome, Asperger's
    - Not specific to socio-economic and cultural factors
    - MT & ASD - Amelia Oldfield
- Example video in slides
    - Would you be able to know that this child has autism?
    - When engaging in music, there is no way to know
- Symptoms
    - Deficits in communication and social skills
    - May display "behaviours"
    - Typically symptoms surface by age 3
        - Can't tell through birth or early age, no difference with a baby at that time
        - Even if symptoms come up before, no way to really tell so avoid diagnosing then
    - Diagnosis includes: impairment of reciprocal social interaction, verbal communication, and restricted repetoire of interests (may include stereotypical/repetitive movements)
- History
    - Leo Kanner (psychiatrist) introduced the label "Early Infantile Autism" in 1943
        - Reasoned that it occurred because mothers would not provide infants with the love/support they needed, and as a result they developed autism
- Causes
    - Unknown (genetic/environment)
    - No genetic markers found yet
    - "Refrigerator Mother" of Leo Kanner was debunked
- Rethinking ASD
    - Research is helping us to gain a better understanding of ASD, how to support people, and how to recognize abilities within a diagnosis such as ASD
    - Music can often highlight abilities
    - Many support and awareness groups advocating for people with ASD
        - Some people still stuck on not accepting and celebrating differences
- ASD and MT Interventions
    - Typically working towards **communication, social interactions, sensory processing, behavioural issues, and music therapy**
    - **PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System)** - collaborate with SLP
    - Music is flexible
    - Expressive and receptive language
    - Call and response; repetitive lyrics
    - Motivation/prompt interaction - successful tool for meaningful interactions
    - Helps to let people to be loud and "let loose", freely vocalize and make any behaviours without judgement or complaint from others, but actually get support from the MT
    - People on the spectrum commonly have heightened musical abilities, helps to build confidence and self esteem, work on communication by working through music
- Example video for Carley's experience
    - Essentially non-verbal but then was given a computer and could communicate
    - Shows need for a means of self expression
- Live Music
    - Allows MTs to interact and get reactions from the client
    - Very freeing, allows clients to feel heard
    - Music is not usually avoided by ASD patients
    - Sensory processing issues (heightened tough or hearing)
        - Music tends to not cause the same response of "overload" in clients, not a sound that is avoided but one that is invited in
    - Some clients have better than normal abilities in music
        - Some have perfect pitch
        - Can hear a piece and then play/sing it back, remembering notes and lyrics (usually with music training)
- Examples in courseware
    - Evan: Really loud voice, quite overpowering, other children don't know how to interact with him and vice versa
        - Working on musical about how blood circulates through body
        - Found in the end that with Evan's voice and academic excellence, he could read and memorize how blood circulates
        - Became narrator of the musical, doing all accurately by memory
        - Enabled other kids to see value in Evan, sees everyone can contribute when given an opportunity to use their strengths
    - Abdi: Used a special song to help facilitate learning
    - Essentially examples of MT in collaboration with teacher (eg. a "wait your turn song", appropriate personal space)
        - Structure and predictability is important!
    - Can do songs for communication (find a friend, look them in the eye, find a friend and now say hi!), others for bubbles, where to stand in relation with others, internalizing "bubble" spacing
- Predicting Change and Transition in a MT Setting
    - Having a predictable environment is important for handling anxiety
    - White board/schedules/visual cues
    - Predictable space
    - Eg. Hello/Movement song/Singing/Playing drums/Surprise or choice/Dice/Closing
    - Additional goals may include; academia, physical/motor, leisure
- Case Study: Amelia Oldfield
    - 5yr old boy with language disorder; not diagnosed with autism but lot of crossover and similarities
        - Jamie, only child, assessed at age 3 with a language disorder
        - History and background of client matter!
    - 2yrs of Group and Individual Music Therapy
- Music Therapy Assessment
    - Is music therapy useful for this client?
    - What would the treatment plan look like?
    - Abilities highlighted in music?
    - Suggest ways parents and teachers could use music with Jamie
- Outcome of Assessment
    - Focus on spontaneous communication through music and vocalizations (had not babbled/experimented with sound as a baby)
- Treatment Process (3 Phases over the course of 2yrs)
    - Phase 1
        - Wait list for 1:1 sessions, therefore joined group
        - Musical conversations between children
        - When conducting, Jamie started using more words
    - Phase 2
        - Individual sessions
        - Goals to increase communication, eye contact, vocalizations and spontaneity
        - After 6 months: greater willingness to communicate (at home and in school)
    - Phase 3
        - Goals to diminish "silly behaviours" he had more recently developed such as screaming/throwing objects and communication goals
        - After 4 months: Able to initiate and engage in conversations
