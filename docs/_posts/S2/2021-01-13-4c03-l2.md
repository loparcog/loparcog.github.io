Internet "Nuts and Bolts"
===

What is the Internet?
- You do not necessarily have access directly from your system to service hosts (ie. Facebook, Netflix, etc.)
    - In old days, there were operators that would make connections from you to the given service, acting as a middleman
- Realistically, we have many switches/routers that we contact through our request between us and the service server
- The internet is a billion of connected **computing devices** (PC, server, phone, etc.)
    - *Hosts* = *end systems*
    - Running *network apps*
- There are also **communication links**
    - Fiber, copper, radio, satellite
    - Transmission rate given by *bandwidth*
- Finally, there are **packet switches** to forward packets (chunks of data)
    - This is done by routers and switches
- Network components consist of links (fibers, coaxial cables), interfaces (ethernet/wireless card), and switches/routers (large routers, switches)

Internet Structure: Network of Networks
- **ISP**: End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
    - Types include Tier 1/2/3 ISPs, local ISPs, etc.
    - Tiers usually communicate with ones in their own tiers
- Connection types include...
    - **Customers and Providers**: Customer pays provider for access to the Internet

    - **Peering Relationship**: Peers provide transit between their respective customers

        - Peers do not provide transit between peers
- The structure of these tiers are roughly heirarchical
- At the top/center: **Tier-1 ISPs** (eg. Sprint, AT&T, etc.), national/multi-national coverage
    - Treat each other as equals
    - Interconnect peers privately, also interconnecting at public **network access points (NAPs)**
- Smaller, often regional ISPs are **Tier-2 ISPs**
    - Connect to one or more Tier-1 ISPs
        - Each Tier-1 has many Tier-2 customers
    - Sometimes peer directly with each other, bypassing Tier-1
- Finally is **Tier-3 ISPs** and **local ISPs**
    - Customer of higher tier ISPs
    - Last hop ("access") network (closest to end system)
- A message passes though **many** networks from source host to destination host

Traceroute - a tool to look inside the "blackbox" of the Internet
- **Traceroute** program: Provides delay measurement from source to router along end-end Internet path towards destination
- For all *i*:
    - Sends three packets that will reach router *i* on path towards destination
    - Router *i* will return packets to sender
    - Sender times interval between transmission and reply
- Essentially looks like a hop from IP to IP, each with a ms measurement for the latency of each packet
    - Can tell distance sometimes through latency jumps (ie. going from here to China gives us latency jumps from 6ms to 78ms to 271ms)
- Example could be McMaster, when on campus, McMaster is our local SP, but who is McMaster's ISP?
