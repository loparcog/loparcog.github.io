- Cookies, DNS, and start of sockets

L2: Internet "Nuts and Bolts"
===

What is the Internet?
- You do not necessarily have access directly from your system to service hosts (ie. Facebook, Netflix, etc.)
    - In old days, there were operators that would make connections from you to the given service, acting as a middleman
- Realistically, we have many switches/routers that we contact through our request between us and the service server
- The internet is a billion of connected **computing devices** (PC, server, phone, etc.)
    - *Hosts* = *end systems*
    - Running *network apps*
- There are also **communication links**
    - Fiber, copper, radio, satellite
    - Transmission rate given by *bandwidth*
- Finally, there are **packet switches** to forward packets (chunks of data)
    - This is done by routers and switches
- Network components consist of links (fibers, coaxial cables), interfaces (ethernet/wireless card), and switches/routers (large routers, switches)

Internet Structure: Network of Networks
- **ISP**: End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
    - Types include Tier 1/2/3 ISPs, local ISPs, etc.
    - Tiers usually communicate with ones in their own tiers
- Connection types include...
    - **Customers and Providers**: Customer pays provider for access to the Internet  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/cus.PNG)
    - **Peering Relationship**: Peers provide transit between their respective customers  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/peer.PNG)
        - Peers do not provide transit between peers
- The structure of these tiers are roughly heirarchical
- At the top/center: **Tier-1 ISPs** (eg. Sprint, AT&T, etc.), national/multi-national coverage
    - Treat each other as equals
    - Interconnect peers privately, also interconnecting at public **network access points (NAPs)**
- Smaller, often regional ISPs are **Tier-2 ISPs**
    - Connect to one or more Tier-1 ISPs
        - Each Tier-1 has many Tier-2 customers
    - Sometimes peer directly with each other, bypassing Tier-1
- Finally is **Tier-3 ISPs** and **local ISPs**
    - Customer of higher tier ISPs
    - Last hop ("access") network (closest to end system)
- A message passes though **many** networks from source host to destination host

Traceroute - a tool to look inside the "blackbox" of the Internet
- **Traceroute** program: Provides delay measurement from source to router along end-end Internet path towards destination
- For all *i*:
    - Sends three packets that will reach router *i* on path towards destination
    - Router *i* will return packets to sender
    - Sender times interval between transmission and reply
- Essentially looks like a hop from IP to IP, each with a ms measurement for the latency of each packet
    - Can tell distance sometimes through latency jumps (ie. going from here to China gives us latency jumps from 6ms to 78ms to 271ms)
- Example could be McMaster, when on campus, McMaster is our local SP, but who is McMaster's ISP?

L3: Internet Continued
===

Traceroute
- Who is McMaster's ISP?
    - Looking through the traceroute result, we can work out that Orion and Cogent are both internet providers, as well as fibre wired "outside" services
- Situations like packet loss may occur when return times are printed as `* *`
    - Why does packet loss occur?
    - Why are there variable delays and what are the factors that contribute to this?
        - What can we do about them?

Packet-Switching: Store-And-Forward
- Application message is broken down into **packets**, typically ~1000 bytes each
- **Store and Forward**: The entire packet **must** arrive at a router before it can be transmitted to the next link
    - Forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination
- Individual packets can be forwarded along **different network paths**, so all packets don't need to go down the same route
- How do loss and delay occur?
    - Packets stored in router buffers
    - Packet arrival rate to link exceeds output link capacity
        - Packets queue, wait for their turn, causing delay
        - Delay can also be caused through transmission (travel time), packet processing (deciding route), and propagation delay (distance and max speed)
    - Loss can occur if no free buffers are available in the router, causing any new packet(s) to be dropped
- So overall, we have four sources of packet delay:
    1. **Processing Delay (Computational)**: Check bit errors, determine output link, deep packet inspection ($\mu s$)
    2. **Queueing Delay**: Time waiting at output link for transmission, depends on congestion level of router (ms)
        - Let *R* = link bandwidth (bps), *L* = packet length (bits), and *a* = average packet arrival rate (packet/s)
        - The **traffic intensity** is given as:  
            $$\text{Traffic Intensity} = \frac{L * a}{R}$$
        - $TI \approx 0$: Average queueing delay **small**
        - $TI \approx 1$: Delay becomes **large**
        - $TI \gt 1$: More "work" arriving than can be services, average delay **infinite**
            - True if the buffer is infinitely large, but we experience packet loss instead
    3. **Transmission Delay (Outgoing)**: Where *R* is the link bandwidth (bps) and *L* is the packet length (bits), the time to send bits into the link is calculated by $L/R$
    4. **Propagation Delay**: Where *d* is the length of the physical link and *s* is the propagation speed in the medium (assume light speed $3*10^8$ m/sec), the propagation delay is calculated by $d/s$
        - NOTE: *s* and *R* are **very** different values
        - Difference can be seen [at this helpful animation](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/ecs_kurose_compnetwork_7/cw/content/interactiveanimations/transmission-vs-propogation-delay/transmission-propagation-delay-ch1/index.html)
- **Nodal Delay**: Total delay of a internet system:
    $$d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}$$
- $d_{proc}$: Processing delay (typically a few microseconds or less)
- $d_{queue}$: Queueing delay (depends on the level of network loads)
- $d_{trans}$: Transmission delay (L/R, significant for low-speed links)
- $d_{prop}$: Propagation delay (a few microseconds to hundreds of msecs)

L4: Internet Finish, Internet Architecture & Design Start
===

Example
- Houston sends a message of 50 000 bytes to Mark on Mars over a radio link at speed 1Kbps. The distance between Mars and Earth are the orbital closet distance of 56 million km
    - NOTE: K**b**ps = bits, K**B**ps = bytes 
- Q: How long does it take for the message to reach Mark from Houston (HINT: Ignore processing and queueing delay, the speed of light is $3*10^8$)
    - SOLN:  
    We know transmission delay is length of the packet divided by the link speed:  
        $$d_{trans} = (50000*8)/1000 = 400s$$  
    Furthermore, the propagation delay is the distance divided by the speed of transmission in the medium (speed of light):  
        $$d_{prop} = 56*10^9 / 3 *10^8 = 186s$$  
    Therefore, our total delay is **586s**

Example 2
- Houston sends a message of 50 000 bytes to Mark on Mars over a radio link at speed 1Kbps. The distance between Mars and Earth are the orbital **furthest** distance of **140 million km** apart
- Q: How long does it take for the message to reach Mark from Houston (HINT: Ignore processing and queueing delay, the speed of light is $3*10^8$)
    - SOLN:  
    Transmission delay will be the same:  
        $$d_{trans} = 400s$$  
    But now, the propagation delay will be:  
        $$d_{prop} = 140 * 10^9 / 3 * 10^8$$  
    Compute and solve

Packet Losses
- Transmission links can be unreliable
    - Bit error rate of ~$10^{-6}$ in radios, and $10^{-15}$ over optical
- Queues (or buffers) have finite capacity
    - When a packet arrives to a full queue, the packet is dropped/lost (which one is dropped? Depends on system)
- Lost packets may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not retransmitted at all
    - Task of a reliable end-packet will be left to the end system

Internet Architecture & Design
===

Internet Protocols
- **Protocols** control sending/receiving of messages
    - eg. TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11
- Internet standards exist for these protocols
    - RFC: Request for Comments
    - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
- What is a protocol?
    - Protocols define **format, order of messages sent/received** among network entities, and **actions taken** on message transmission, receipt (eg. TCP, IP, HTTP, FTP, PPP, ICMP)
    - Like a conversation between people, rules and standards usually followed for polite conversations
- Protocol "Layers"
    - Networks are complex, with many "pieces" like hosts, routers, links of various media, applications, protocols, and hardware/software
        - How to manage all of thses
    - Management done through **layering**, grouping common systems together
    - Example could be top application layer for SMTP, SSH, and FTP, followed by a transmission media layer for things like coaxial cables and fiber optics
        - Each application needs to interface with **all** existing transmission media
        - Adding a new application would be $O(m)$ work, where *m* is the number of transmission medias
        - Likewise, adding a new media would be $O(a)$ work, where *a* is the number of applications  
    - This example can be seen below:  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/lay.PNG)
    - Total work in system would be $O(ma)$, would become too large to manage over time
- The above would be far too much work to get going, how do we fix?
    - We can add an **intermediate layer**, providing a single abstraction for various network technologies
    - Would only require $O(1)$ work to add an app or a media
    - Indirection is an often used technique in computer science  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/int.PNG)

Network Architecture
- Architecture is not the implementation itself, but how to "organize" implementations
    - *What* interfaces are supported and *where* functionality is implemented
    - Main focus on modular design of the network
- Many similarities between software and network modularity  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/mod.PNG)
- Key difference is choosing **where** modules are implemented in networks

Layering
- Laying is a particular form of **modularization**, breaking the system down into a **vertical hierarchy** of logically distinct entities (layers)
- Rigid structure: easy for reuse, but performance may suffer  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/layer.PNG)
- Key concepts of layering
    - **Service**: Says what a layer does
        - Ethernet: Unreliable subnet unicast/multicast/broadcast datagram service
        - IP: Unreliable end-to-end unicast datagram service
        - TCP: Reliable end-to-end bi-directional byte stream service
    - **Service Interface**: Says how to access the service
        - eg. Socket interface
    - **Protocol**: Says how the service is implemented
        - A set of rules and message formats that govern the communication between two peers

Internet Protocol Architecture
- The **TCP/IP protocol suite** is the basis for the networks that we call The Internet
- The TCP/IP suite has four layers: **Application, Transport, Network, and (Data) Link Layer**
- **Computers (hosts)** implement all four layers
    - **Routers** (gateways) only have the bottom two layers and some network devices have implemented by the bottom layers  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipa.PNG)
- Example of layering in action:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/lia.PNG)
- Each layer adds their own header information onto the message to help it be received and read by the end system

L5: Layers
===

Services of the Layers
- **Application**: Supporting network applications (FTP, SMTP, HTTP)
- **Transport**: Process-to-process data transfer (TCP, UDP)
- **Network**: Routing of datagrams from source to destination (IP, Routing protocols)
- **Link**: Data transfer between neighboring network elements (Ethernet, 802.11 (WiFi), PPP)
    - Note: Usage of each layer varies for different applications/uses
- Further layering example:
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/lex.PNG)
- Layering is a convenient way to think about networks, but is not always followed rigorously
    - **Middle-boxes**: Firewalls, network address translation
    - Cross layer optimization

The Internet Design Question
- Support for common services (for diverse applications)
    - Reliability?
    - In-order delivery?
    - Guaranteed bandwidth?
    - Low latency?
    - Accountability?
    - Security?
- What functionalities should be supported?
- Where should the functionality be placed?
- Two design principles
    - In fact it's just one, but from different perspective
    - At the network core: **the hourglass model**
    - From the end system's point of view: **end-to-end argument**
- **The Hourglass Model**
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hglass.PNG)
    - Lots of diversity at top and bottom of the stack, but we want something that remains constant for communication
    - That is where the "waist" comes in, allowing everything to communicate through a common medium like IP, to ensure new technologies work with old ones
    - A single internet layer module
    - Allows all networks to **interoperate**
        - All network technologies that support IP can exchange packets
    - Allows all applications to function on all networks
        - All appliucation that can run on IP can use any network
    - Simultaneous developments above and below IP
    - **Router implementation simplified**
- **The End-to-End Argument**
    - Leave it to the end-hosts, if implementing this functionality to the network:
        1. Doesn't reduce host implementation complexity
        2. Does increase network complexity
        3. Probably imposes delay and overhead on all applications, even if they don't need the functionality
    - Essentially options are implementing functionality in the network or in the end-hosts
- Case Study
    1. Reliability: Message is correctly and eventually delivered from application process on the source to the destination host
        - This would not reduce host implementation complexity
        - This would greatly increase network complexity
        - It can impose delay and overhead for applications that don't need it
            - Therefore this **should not** be left to the end-hosts
        - However, implementing this in the network can 
    2. Data Privacy: Application data should remain private (not visible to 3rd parties)
        - Add additional layer for privacy, not reduce complexity
        - Same network complexity
        - Would impose delay/overhead
            - Therefore this **should not** be left to the end-hosts

L6: Principles of Network Applications
===

Application Layer
- Services: Supporting network applications
    - Protocols: FTP, SMTP, HTTP, HTTP, SIP, RTP, RTSP
    - Applications: File transfer, email, web browser, skype, media streaming, etc.
- Uses **socket interfaces** from the transport layer (TCP & UDP)
- Architectures: 
    - **Client-Server**
        - **Server**: Always-on host, permanent IP address, data centers for scaling
        - **Clients**: Communicate with server, may be intermittently connected, may have dynamic IP addresses, **do not communicate directly with each other**
    - **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**
        - No always-on server
        - Arbitrary end systems directly communicate
        - Peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
            - **Self scalability** -  new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
        - Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
            - Complex management
    - **Hybrid**   
        - Servers provide account authentication and maintains information for clients
        - Data communication is done **directly** between clients

Communication Processes
- **Process**: Program running within a host
    - Within same host, two processes communicate using **inter-process communication** (supported by OS)
    - Processes in different hosts communicate by **exchanging messages**
    - Client/Server: Client process initiates communication, server process waits to be contacted
    - P2P: Have both client and server processes

Sockets
- Process sends/receives messages to/from it's socket
- Socket analogous to *door*
    - Sending process shoves message out of a door
    - Sending process relies on transport infrastructure on other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process

Addressing Processes
- To receive messages, a process must have an **identifier**
- Host device has a unique IP address
- Identifier includes both **IP address** and **port numbers** associated with process on host
- Ex: Port numbers
    - HTTP server: 80
    - SMTP mail server: 25
- To send HTTP request to `www.cas.mcmaster.ca`:
    - IP address: 130.113.68.10
    - Port number: 80

Requirements of Common Apps
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/rca.PNG)

Internet Transport Protocols Service
- **TCP Service**
    - Reliable transport between sending/receiving processes
    - Flow Control: sender won't overwhelm receiver
    - Congestion Control: Throttle sender when network overloaded
    - Does not Provide: Timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security
    - Connection-Oriented: Setup required between client and server processes
- **UDP Service**
    - Unreliable data transfer between sending and receiving processes
    - Does not Provide: reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, connection setup
    - Less overhead though
- Applications and their associated protocols  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/rca2.PNG)

L7: Web and HTTP
===

Review
- Web pages consist of objects
- Objects can be an HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file, etc.
- Web page consists of base HTML-file, which includes several referenced objects
- Each object is addressable by a **uniform request identifier (URI)**, eg. `www.someschool.edu/someDept/pic.gif`
    - In the example, `www.someschool.edu` is the host name, and `someDept/pic.gif` is the path name
    - Note: URL includes the identifier and the protocol, whereas URI is just the object

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- Web's application layer protocol
- Client/server model
    - **Client**: Browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and "displays" web objects
    - **Server**: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests
- **TCP**
    - Client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, **port 80**
    - Server attempts TCP connection from client
    - HTTP messages (application-layer protocol) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and web server (HTTP server)
    - TCP connection closed
- HTTP is "stateless"
    - Server maintains no information about past client requests
    - Protocols that do maintain state are quite complex
- **Non-Persistent HTTP**
    - **At most one object** sent over TCP connection
        - Connection then closed
    - HTTP/1.0 uses non-persistent HTTP
    - Typically multiple TCP connections
    - Example: Suppose user enters a given URL, with text and references to 10 jpeg images
        1. HTTP client initiates TCP connection to HTTP server (process) at the host on port 80
        2. HTTP server at host waiting for TCP connection at port 80, "accepts" connection and notifies client
        3. HTTP client sends HTTP **request message** (containing URL) into TCP connection socket, message indicates that the client wants object at the URL
        4. HTTP server receives request message, forms **response message** containing requested object, and sends message into its socket
            - Time between sending request message and getting a response message is **1 Round Trip Time (RTT)**
        5. HTTP server closes TCP connection
        6. HTTP client receives response message containing HTML file, displays HTML. Parsing HTML file finds 10 referenced jpeg objects
        7. Steps 1-6 repeat for each of the 10 JPEG objects (in parallel)
    - Looks like high overhead but advantage in retrieving multiple objects in parallel
- **Persistent HTTP**
    - **Multiple objects** can be sent over a single TCP connection between client/server
    - HTTP/1.1 uses persistent connections in default mode
    - Example: Suppose user enters a given URL, with text and references to 10 jpeg images
        1. HTTP client initiates TCP connection to HTTP server (process) at the host on port 80
        2. HTTP server at host waiting for TCP connection at port 80, "accepts" connection and notifies client    
        3. HTTP client sends HTTP request message (containing URL) into TCP connection socket, indicating the client wants object `someDepartment/home.index`
        4. HTTP server receives request message, forms response message containing requested object, and sends message into its socket
        5. HTTP client receives response message containing html file, displays html, and finds 10 referenced JPEG objects
        6. Steps 3-5 repeated for each of the 10 jpeg objects (sequentially)
        7. HTTP server closes TCP connection after some time or when the client closes the connection
    - Persistent **without** pipelining
        - Client issues new request only when previous response has been received
        - 1 RTT for each referenced object
    - Persistent **with** pipelining
        - Default in HTTP/1.1
        - Client sends request as soon as it encounters a referred object
        - As little as 1 RTT for **all** referenced objects
- HTTP Request Message
    - ASCII (human-readable format)
    - Request line: method, resource, and protocol version
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/htr.PNG)
- Method Types
    - HTTP/1.0
        - `GET`: Request an object specified by the URL
        - `POST`: Request that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request
        - `HEAD`: Ask server to leave requested object out of response (only meta info)
    - HTTP/1.1
        - `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`
        - `PUT`: Uploads file/resource in entity body to path specified in URL field
        - `DELETE`: Deletes resource specified in the URL field
- Uploading Form Input
    - **POST Method**
        - Web page often includes form input
        - Input uploaded to server in entity body:  
            ```
            POST /text/demo_form.asp HTTP1.1
            Host: w3schools.com
            name1=value1&name2=value2
            ```
    - **GET Method**
        - Input (name/value pairs) is uploaded in URL field of request line  
            ```
            /test/demo_form.asp?name1=value1&name2=value2
            ```
    - Comparison
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/gp.PNG)
    - **Security Vulnerabilities**
        - URI in clear-text in GET
        - Attackers can exploit buffer overflow in buggy server software by getting/posting a very long URI
- HTTP Response Message  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/resp.PNG)
    - **Status codes** appear in the 1st line in server-to-client response messages
        - Sample codes include `200 OK` (request succeeded, requested object later in this message), `301 Moved Permanently` (requested object moved, new location specified later in this message), etc.

L8: Cookies
===

Cookies
- HTTP itself is stateless, but it is often desirable to identify users
    - Restriction, customizing content, etc
- **Cookies**: HTTP messages **carry** state
- There are four components:
    1. Cookie header line of HTTP response message
    2. Cookie header line in next HTTP request message
    3. Cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser
    4. Backend database at website
- Example: Susan always accesses internet from PC
    - Visited eBay before and visits Amazon for the first time
    - When initial HTTP requests arrives at site, site creates:
        - Unique ID (different than eBay, managed by Amazon)
        - Entry in backend database for ID
    - Response message returns ID in form of cookie, storing it locally in the browser
    - Any new requests to Amazon will use the cookie stored to get the user ID, and populate the site with session-specific content
- Cookies can be used for...
    - Authorization
    - Shopping carts
    - Recommendations
    - User session state
- Can be issues with privacy, however
    - Cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you
    - Third-party cookies can track users across multiple sites (eg. Google AdSense)
        - Do not need to be visible ads or anything, can be invisible cookies

Domain Name System (DNS)
- People use **hostname** for things (eg. first names, identifiers)
    - Not as easy to process from network perspective, routers like working with numbers and IPs
    - Need to translate things like `mcmaster.ca` to their respective host and IP
- Hosts, routers use IP address for addressing datagrams
    - How to map between IP address and hostname?
- Hostname to IP Address Translation
    - Host/server aliasing: Can have different canonical vs alias names (eg. `mcmaster.ca` is an alias to the canonical `pinwps02.uts.mcmaster.ca`, found through traceroute)
    - Load distribution: Replicated web servers, using a set of IP addresses for one canonical name (eg. `google.com` could be seen through traceroute to use multiple IPs)
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**
    - Distributed database implemented in hierarchy of many name servers
    - Application-layer protocol
        - Address/name translation
- Why not centralize DNS?
    - Would make single point of failure
    - Create high traffic volume
    - Latency to access distant centralized database
    - Maintenance (doesn't scale)
- Distributed, hierarchical database model
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dhd.PNG)
    - There are also local DNS servers, not part of the hierarchy but exists
- DNS: Root name servers
    - 13 logical servers in total
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/rns.PNG)
    - Contacted by local name server that can not resolve name
    - Root name server
        - Contacts authoritative name server for the appropriate domains if name mapping not known
        - Gets and returns mapping
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers**: Responsible for com, org, net, edu, etc., and all top-level country domains such as ca, uk, fr, etc.
- **Authoritative DNS Servers**: Organization's DNS servers, providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization's servers (eg. web and mail)
    - Can be maintained by organization or service provider
- **Local Name Server**
    - Does not strictly belong to hierarchy
    - Each ISP (residential ISP, company, university) has one
        - Also called "default name server"
    - When a host makes a DNS query, query is sent to its local DNS server
        - Acts as a **proxy**, forwards query into hierarchy
- Once (any) name server learns a mapping, it **caches** the mapping
    - Cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time
    - TLD servers typically cached in local name servers
        - Thus root name servers not often visited
    - Update/notify mechanisms under design by IETF, RFC 2136
- Two types of queries to resolve the host name
    1. **Recursive Queries**: Ask a server to get an answer for you. If the server does not have the answer, send the query to the next server in the chain, continually going until you get to the server with the answer
        - Starts on local DNS server, then goes to root, then TLD DNS, finally ending up at authoritative
        - **Depth-first**
    2. **Iterative Queries**: Instead of chaining servers, check your local DNS server, and then from your local DNS server, go out to each other server (root, TLD, authoritative), getting the address for each new sever from the last one
        - Same idea, but no more chain, shallow comms all done directly from local DNS server
        - Need to follow same path of root to TLD to authoritative since each prior server gives the path to the next server
        - **Breadth-first**
- You can get a DNS message example using the command line tool `dig`
    - This command acts recursively by default

L9: DNS Protocol
===

DNS Records
- DNS info stored as **resource records (RRs)**
    - RR format: `(name, TTL, class, type, value)`
    - **TTL (Time To Live)**, used by authoritative DNS for indicating the validity of RR to caching DNS
- Type 1: **A (Address)**
    - `name` = hostname
    - `value` = IP address
    - eg. `pinweps02.uts.mcmaster.ca. 3600 IN A 130.113.64.30`
        - `IN` means internet protocol
- Type 2: **NS (Name Server)**
    - `name` = domain
    - `value` = name of DNS server for domain
    - eg. `uts.mcmaster.ca 86400 IN NS pindns03.mcmaster.ca.`
- Type 3: **CNAME (Canonical NAME)**
    - `name` = hostname
    - `value` = canonical name
    - eg. `www.mcmaster.ca. 3600 IN CNAME pinwps02.uts.mcmaster.ca`
        - Look at it like a "nickname" for the canonical server
- Type 4: **MX (Mail eXchanger)**
    - `name` = domain in email address
    - `value` = canonical name of mail server

DNS Protocol, Messages
- **DNS Protocol**: Query and reply messages, both with same message format
    - Application layer protocol uses **UDP Port 53**
        - Also uses TCP too, but not always implemented
    - **Message header**
        - Identification: 16 bit # for query, reply to query uses same #
    - Flags:
        - Query or reply
        - Recursion desired
        - Recursion available
        - Reply is authoritative
- Example

- Can get this through command line by using `dig +trace`

Attacking DNS
- **DDoS Attacks**: Bombard root servers with traffic 
    - 1hr on Oct 21 2002, ICMP Ping attacks on 13 Root servers
    - 24hr on Feb 6, 2007
    - 5 million queries on Nov 30/Dec 1 2015
    - Bombarding TLD servers can be potentially more dangerous
- Remedies
    - Traffic filtering
    - Distributing requests to other root servers
    - Local DNS servers cache IPs of TLD server, allowing root server bypass
- **Redirect Attacks**
    - Main-in-middle
        - Intercept queries
    - DNS poisoning
        - Send bogus replies to DNS server, which caches
    - Exploit DNS for DDoS
        - Send queries with spoofed source address, being a target IP
- Remedies
    - Use cryptographically signed response, eg. DNSSEC and DNSCurve

Socket Programming
- Goal: Learn how to build client/server applications that communicate using sockets
- **Socket**: Door between application process and end-to-end transport protocol
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sock.PNG)
- Two socket types for two transport services
    - **UDP**: Unreliable datagram, **connection-less**
    - **TCP**: Reliable, byte stream-oriented, **connection-oriented**
- Application Example:
    1. Client reads a line of characters (data) from its keyboard and sends the data to the server
    2. The server receives the data and converts characters to uppercase
    3. The server sends the modified data to the client
    4. The client receives the modified data and displays the line on its screen
- With UDP
    - UDP: No "connection" between client and server
        - No handshaking before sending data
        - Sender program explicitly attaches IP destination address and port # to **each packet**
        - Receiver program extracts sender IP address and port # from received packet
    - UDP: Transmitted data may be lost or received out of order
    - Application viewpoint: UDP provides unreliable transfer of groups of bytes ("datagrams") between client and server
    - Client/server socket interaction: UDP
