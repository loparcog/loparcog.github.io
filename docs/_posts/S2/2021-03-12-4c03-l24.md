Data Link Layer
===

Data Link Layer Properties
- High Diversity:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dllhd.PNG)
    - Can be used and accessed in a large number of ways
    - Going to mainly focus on Ethernet and LAN
- Fast Evolution: Grown to be 10 000x faster in 20 years


Link Layer Introduction
- Communication channel that connects adjacent nodes along communication paths are **links**
    - Can be wired/wireless
- Layer-2 packet is a **frame**, encapsulates a datagram
- Data-link layer has responsibility of transferring frames from one node to adjacent nodes over a link

Network Interface Card, Drivers
- Network Interface Card
    - Firmware: Program stored on the network card's ROM (BIOS) and configuration info stored in E2PROM
    - Hardware: ICs, connectors
- Drivers: Software interface between the network card hardware/firmware and the OS

Link Layer Services
- **Flow Control**: Pacing between adjacent sending and receiving nodes
- **Error Detection**: Errors caused by signal attenuation, noise, interference
    - Receiver detects presence of errors, signals sender for retransmission or drops frame
- **Error Correction**: Receiver identifies and corrects bit error(s) without resorting to retransmission
- Which layer provides similar services?
    - Transport layer, specifically TCP
- **Half/Full Duplex**: With half duplex, nodes at both ends of the link can transmit, but *not at the same time!*
- **Framing**: Continuous bit stream at physical layer
    - Encapsulate datagram into frame, adding header and/or trailer
- **Link Access**: Channel access if shared medium

Channel/Medium Access
- Two types of "links":
    - **Point-to-Point** (dedicated pairwise communication)
        - PPP for dial-up access
        - Point-to-point link between host and switch
        - Switched ethernet
    - **Broadcast** (shared wire or medium)
        - Traditional ethernet
        - Need to detect collision
        - 802.11 wireless LAN

MAC Addresses
- 32-bit IP address:
    - Network-layer address
    - Configured, or learned dynamically
    - Used to get datagram to destination IP subnet
- **MAC Address**
    - Used to get datagram from one interface to another physically-connected interface (same network)
    - **48-bit** MAC address (eg. `1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD` in HEX)
        - Unique, hard-coded in the adapter ROM when it is built
- **Broadcast Address**: Sent to AAA
- Allocation administered by IEEE
- Manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space (to assure uniqueness)
- MAC flat address -> portability
    - Can move LAN card from one LAN to another
- IP hierarchical address NOT portable
    - Depends on IP subnet to which node is attached

APR: Address Resolution Protocol
- Q: How to determine the MAC address of *B* knowing *B*'s IP address?
    - Each IP node (Host, Router) on LAN has an ARP Table
    - **ARP Table**: IP/MAC address mappings for some LAN nodes, given as `<IP Address; MAC Address; TTL>`
        - TTL (Time to Live): Time after which address mapping will be forgotten (typically 20min)
ARP Request Ex
- Argon has the IP address of Router 137 (eg. via DHCP)
- Argon broadcasts an ARP request to all stations on the network:  
    `"What is the MAC address of Router137?"`  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/arpex.PNG)
    - NOTE: The IP in the ARP request should match the IP of the router, image is wrong
- Router 137 responds with an ARP Reply which contains its MAC address:

ARP Packet Format

- Example:

ARP Cache
- Since sending an ARP request/reply for each IP datagram is inefficient, hosts maintain a cache (ARP Cache) of current entries
    - The entries expire after 20 minutes

"Specialized" ARP Messages
- **ARP Probe**: Check if anyone is using an IP address ("Is anyone using this address?", commonly followed by "This is the address I hope to use")
    - All-zero sender IP address
    - Sender hardware address sets to its own MAC address
    - Target MAC address set to all zeros
    - Target IP address set to the address being probed
- **ARP Announcement**: "This is the IP address I am now using"
    - Both the sender and the target IP address fields contain the IP address being announced

DHCP vs ARP
- DHCP: Acquiring an IP Address
    - Broadcast "I need an IP address"
    - Response "You can have IP address 192.0.0.0"
- ARP: DIscovering the Receiver
    - Broadcast "Who has IP address 192.0.0.0?"
    - Response: "00-E0-23-6F-A8-20 has 192.0.0.0"

MAC Spoofing and ARP Poisoning
- MAC addresses can be easily modified
    - One liner on OSX: `sudo ifconfig en0 ether 5e:c4:a4:99:b8:e3`
    - Implications: MAC address filtering in WLAN access control isn't really "secure"
- ARP Poisoning
    - No authentication in ARP
    - AN attacker can use ARP announcements to poison ARP caches
