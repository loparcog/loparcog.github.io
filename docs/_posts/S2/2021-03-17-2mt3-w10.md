Music Therapy and Palliative Care
===

Hospice and Palliative Care
- Philosophy of care - end of life (terminal illness, declining health, etc, many different durations of time)
- Team oriented approach
- Enhanced comfort and QoL
- Prevent suffering/relieve pain
- Guided by wishes of the patient
    - eg. Even if bloodwork would help doctors to identify problems with patient, if the patient doesn't want it, they won't do it
    - Can also be helped by relatives
- NOTE: Hospice and Palliative Care can be different in some respects, but for the course they are the same

MT in Palliative Care
- About living to the fullest - in the moment - NOT about dying
- What does MT palliative care look like?
    - Sound is the first sense we get and last one we lose
    - Helps for pain reduction and management
    - Helps to "embrace palliative care philosophy", person-centered not illness-centered
    - Palliative care not always "bed-ridden, non-verbal", many people actively involved in their day-to-day, just have a terminal illness
    - Non-intrusive, no need to ask how the patient is doing or handling illness, but can get the answers to this (mood, physicality, etc.) through regular instrument playing, song choices, communication and movement
    - Can also help family members to cope

Who Benefits?
- All ages of people who are terminally ill
- Family and friends by participating in the session (if the patient would like)
- Health care team (secondary, but music often helps the health care team to lower their anxiety and elevate their mood as well)

Hospice Team and Music Therapy
- MTs can focus the interventions across physical, emotional, spiritual, cognitive, or social needs
- Whole person
- Non-invasive, cost-effective (significantly less than pharmisutical costs for pain/mood management)
    - Shouldn't necessarily replace pharmisuticals, but can reduce their need
- Can be passive or active

Goals
- Psychosocial (anxiety, loss, spirituality, autonomy/control, isolation, family, cohesion)
- Pain Management, **most common symptom**
- Manage Dyspnea (shortness of breath), entertainment
- Manage sleep difficulties 

Biomedical Theory of Music Therapy
- "Analgesic" effects of music
    - Can relieve a pain, so strong such that in a study w/ no distraction, white noise, music they did not choose, and music they did choose, strongest effects was for the music they chose
    - Not just "distracting", but personal to work
- Distraction hypothesis

Use of Music to Impact Pain Perception
- Pain is subjective
- Increase in endorphins = pain perception reduction
    - Music enhances endorphin production

The Research
- Pain and Anxiety Reduction with Music (in courseware)
    - Koch et al 1998, Spintge 1989, Sehhati-Chafai & Kau 1985
    - Further supports pain and anxiety reduction in hospital settings through music

Treating "Total Pain"
- In order to lessen the experience of pain while in palliative care, one needs to treat the **total pain experience**, meaning the following aspects:
    - Psychological: Loss, symptoms of depression, closure
    - Emotional: Explore/express emotions
    - Social: Social interactions
    - Spiritual: Explore/express spirituality
    - Physical: Play an instrument/sing
    - Biopsychosoical Approach: Physically, social, and mentally involved
        - Physical not just movement, but elevation of endorphins and neurological responses

Psychosocial Support
- Can be achieved through engaging in music therapy, support palliative care philosophy
- Looking to support feelings of...
    - Anxiety
    - Depression
    - Isolation
    - Confusion
    - Grief
    - Impaired communication
    - Ineffective coping
    - Self-esteem
    - Relationship/family issues
    - Life review

Interventions
- Many different interventions can be used with a client in palliative care, including
    - Music listening
    - Improvisation
    - Singing
        - Music uses both sides of the brain, and can be maintained past social ability
        - Provide QoL and connect with others in a meaningful way
    - Song writing
    - Music playing
    - GIM
    - Lyric analysis
    - Iso-principle, matching patient's mood with music
    - MAR (music assisted relaxation)

About Jean (Courseware)
- Dementia and severe arthritis
- Living in LTC
- Pain management (new bandage dressings)
    - Way that her hand grips, the nails go into her hand
    - Bandages looked to ease pain, but changing them also caused pain
    - MT used to help minimize the experience of pain
- MT matched client's vocalizations
    - Vocalizations of pain from client
    - Matched along with guitar
- Change vocalizations to encourage deep breathing
- Improvising/reminiscent lyrics
    - Singing about the farm Jean used to live on or other memories
- More relaxed during/after MT sessions
- Caregivers also felt less stressed while changing dressings

About Bud (Courseware)
- ALS (muscles/organs begin to deteriorate)
- Weak, difficult to swallow foods
- Anxious due to laboured breathing
- Didn't want to see friends since he felt he couldn't relate with them
- Vocal and guitar movement provided
    - Work on vocalizing so he had more breath and better breathing
    - Was a guitar player before, so Bud also helped MT, gave him a sense of control and something he could provide to someone else
- Outcomes included...
    - Positive distraction
    - Anxiety reduction
    - Positive reminiscence
    - More comfortable for friends and family to join, could see Bud as Bud, not as a man with an illness
        - Less self-conscious about symptoms
    - Spiritual support
    - Control
    - Improve social interaction
    - Finding meaning and purpose

About Dan (Courseware)
- Non-responsive, end of life
- Difficult time for family members, unsure how to act or do anything
    - So many unknowns, unsure how to interact in final days with family
- MT previously aware of working with Dan, aware of music he liked
    - Shared music books used with Dan with family, family recognized songs and reminisced on memories from them
    - MT began singing songs and the family members joined in
    - Began choosing other songs that had memories for them about Dan
    - Way for family members to engage with Dan even though Dan could not participate
    - Had a "sense" of being with Dan with music and bringing memory back, sharing positive experiences
    - Understood that even though not responsive, Dan could hear the environment and music and memories being shared
        - Can be very supportive/meaningful moment for family members of people in palliative care
- Main takeaway that palliative care includes family
    - MT provided positive memories in a situation where the family felt helpless and distressed

Children in Hospice - Emily (Courseware)
- Not just people with long fulfulling life in palliative care, children can also deal with this through terminal illnesses
- Emily was 6yrs old with an inoperable tumour
- Wanted means of normailzation and output for creativity
- MT sessions with family (younger siblings)
- Wanted to sing with everyone around her, sang/was sung her favourite song repeatedly
- Recordings made for family, positive memories

Take-Homes of Courseware Examples
- Highlights how flexible the music therapist needs to be while working in palliative care, "adapt in the moment"
    - Clients can rapidly change, one day doing song writing with a client and the next they may not be able to cognitively engage with the therapist
    - Need to shift from song writing to more receptive music therapy interventions
- Singing, music listening, song choices are adaptable to all ages and levels of functioning
    - Makes it a great tool in this setting

Music to keep a Patient Awake? (Courseware)
- Why?
    - Back to QoL, if an individual is struggling with engaging with activities and others in the day but awake in the night, need to shift energy cycle
    - Using music can help make this better and more interesting for the client rather than forcing them to be awake

Bereavement
- Working with friends/family who had recently lost someone who was in palliative care
- Usually hand in hand with palliative care MT
