Framing and Error Detection
===

Recall...
- Seven layers of the internet stack
    - **Application Software**
        - Application
        - Presentation
        - Session
    - **Kernel Software (Device Driver)**
        - Transport (Reliability)
        - Network (Routing)
    - **Hardware (Network Adapter)**
        - Data Link (Framing, error detection, medium access control, reliability)
        - Physical (Encoding, modulation)
- Will look @ data link layer this section

Framing
- **Framing** demarcates (sets the boundaries/limits of) units of transfer
    - Separates a continuous stream of bits into frames
    - Marks start and end of each frame
- Objective
    - Synchronization recovery (start and stop bits)
    - Efficient error detection (per-frame error checking and recovery)
- Challenge
    - How can we determine exactly what set of bits constitute a frame?
    - How do we determine the beginning and end of a frame?
- Approaches
    - Sentinel-based (like C strings)
        - Bit- or byte-oriented (marks beginning/end of frame with bits/bytes)
    - Length-based (like Pascal strings)
        - Size of a frame is fixed of variable length, with variable length giving the length in the header
    - Clock-based
        - Frame size depends on how many bits can be transmitted in a specific time unit
        - As long as sender and receiver has synchronized clock, they will know how many bits are in one frame by the number of bits sent in the given time window
- **Sentinel-Based Framing**
    - End of frame marked with a special byte/bit pattern
        - Frame length is data-dependent
    - Challenge when frame marker may be in the data being transferred
        - Make sure marker will not appear in regular data
    - Examples: ARPANET, IMP-IMP, HDLC, PPP, BYSYNC
- **Length-Based Framing**
    - End of frame calculated from length sent at start of frame
    - Challenge when there is a corrupt length marker or corrupt data, may overshoot or undershoot reading length
    - Examples: DDCMP (byte-oriented, variable-length), RS-232 framing (bit-oriented, implicit fixed-length)
- **Clock-Based Framing**
    - All frames take the same amount of time
    - Clocks must remain synchronized, but no extra bit is needed to transmit the data stream
    - Examples: Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)
        - STS-1 link, each frame is 125 $\mu$s (microseconds) long
        - No bit or byte stuffing
- When data is corrupted...
    - Data in frame and on the boundary of a frame may be corrupted
        - Bit errors from noise, hardware failures, software errors, etc.
    - Solution: Make sure we don't accept bad data
        - Provide error detection (and perhaps correction)

Error Detection
- Modulation translates symbols to signals
- Framing demarcates units of transfer
- **Error detection** validates the correctness of each frame
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/modu.PNG)  
- Idea is to add redundant information that can be used to determine if errors have been introduced, and potentially fix them
    - The receiver determines if a set of bits are "legitimate"
- Error checked at many levels
    - Within network adaptor (CRC check)
    - Within IP layer (IP checksum)
    - Possibly within application as well
- Error model
    - Bit error (every bit has a probability to run into an error, independent of one another)
    - Burst error (errors follow certain patterns, therefore error probability not independent for neighboring bits)
- **Hamming Distance**: The distance between legal codewords
    - Measured in terms of number of bit flips *d*
    - Codes of uniform Hamming distance
        - All codewords are equidistant from their neighbors
    - Examples  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ham.PNG)  
        This example has $d = 3$
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ham2.PNG)  
        This example has $d = 2$
- **2d + 1 Hamming Distance** allows for detecting up to $2d$ bit flips
    - The neighboring codeword is always $2d + 1$ bit flips away
    - Can correct up to *d* bit flips
    - Unfortunately, no way to tell how many bit flips  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/ham3.PNG)  
        This example has $d = 1$, so it can detect errors up to 2 bit flips, and correct 1 bit flip
- Revisit repetition encoding
    - Each bit is sent *n* times  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/rep.PNG)  
        $n = 3$ in this example
        - Hamming distance there would be $d = 3$
    - Straightforward duplication is extremely inefficient
- **Digital Error Detection Techniques**
    - Two-dimensional parity
        - Detects up to 3-bit errors
        - Good for burst errors (when error probability of bits are not independent)
    - Checksum
        - Simple addition
        - Simple in software
        - Used as backup to CRC
    - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
        - Powerful mathematics
        - Tricky in software, simple in hardware
        - Used in network adapter
- **Parity Bit**: Add an extra bit to ensure odd/even number of ones
    - For an example, look at a 2-bit frame
        - Can detect any single bit flip (hamming distance 2)
        - Code is 66% efficient (need three bits to encode two)
- **One-Dimensional Parity**: Add bit for even number of 1's
    - Check if a bit goes wrong at the receiver side
    - The parity bit makes the code word contain an even number of 1's
        - If odd, parity bit is 1, otherwise it is 0
    - It is capable to catch odd number of bit errors
- **Two-Dimensional Parity**: One-dimension with extra byte
    - Use one-dimensional parity to set even/odd number of 1's in each byte
    -  Adding second dimension in the form of an extra byte with its own parity bit
        - Bits are set to ensure even/odd number of 1's in that position across all bytes in the frame
    - Will catch all 1, 2, and 3-bit errors, and most 4-bit errors
    - Can also correct 1-bit errors  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/2dp.PNG) 
- **Checksum**: Sum and send as parity
    - Idea is to add up all bytes and transmit the sum
    - IP checksum uses 1's complement sum as a parity byte
    - Comments
        - Small number of redundant bits
        - Easy to implement and easy to compute fast in hardware
        - Not very robust
- **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: Maximize protection, minimize extra bits
    - Add *k* bits of redundant data to an *n*-bit message
    - The *n*-bit message is then represented as an (*n-1*)-degree polynomial with each bit in the message being the corresponding coefficient in the polynomial
    - Example:  
        $$\text{Message} = 10011010$$  
        $$\text{Polynomial} = 1x^7 + 0x^6 + 0x^5 + 1x^4 + 1 x^3 + 0 x^2 + 1 x + 0 $$
        - Select a divisor polynomial $C(x)$ with degree *k*
            - Example with $k = 3$:  
                $$C(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1$$
        - Transmit a polynomial $P(x)$ that is evenly divisible by $C(x)$
            $$ P(x) = M(x) + k \text{ bits}$$
    - Sender steps
        - $T(x)$: Multiply $M(x)$ by $x^k$ (zero extending)
        - Find remainder, $R(x)$, from $T(x)/C(x)$
        - $P(x) = T(x) - R(x) \rightarrow M(x)$, followed by $R(x)$
    - Receiver steps
        - Receive polynomial $P(x) + E(x)$
            - $E(x)$ represents errors, 0 implies no errors
        - Divide $P(x) + E(x)$ by $C(x)$
        - If the result is 0, either
            - No errors ($E(x) = 0, P(x)$ is evenly divisible by $C(x)$)
            - $P(x) + E(x)$ is exactly divisible by $C(x)$, so $E(x)$ is a multiple of $C(x)$, so error not detected
    - What errors can we detect?
        - All single-bit errors, if $x^k$ and $x^0$ have non-zero coefficients
        - All double-bit errors, if $C(x) has at least three terms
        - All odd number of bit errors, if $C(x)$ contains the factor (x + 1)
        - Any bursts of length $\lt k$, if $C(x)$ includes a constant term
        - Most bursts of length $\geq k$
    - Common generator polynomials can be seen here:
