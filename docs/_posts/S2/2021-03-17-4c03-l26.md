CSMA Cont.
===

Collision in CSMA/CD
- *B* and *D* can't tell that collision occurred
- **Jamming Signal**: Inform all other stations they shouldn't transmit

Limits on CSMA/CD Network
- Latency depends on physical length of link
    - Time to propagate a packet from one end to the other
- Suppose *A* sends a packet at time *t*
    - And *B* sees an idle line at a time just before *t+d*
    - ...so *B* happily starts transmitting a packet
- *B* detects a collision, and sends a jamming signal
    - But *A* can't see the collision until *t + 2d*
- This gives implications on minimum frame size
    - May need to pad 0's on the end of a message to make sure this is met

Switched Ethernet
- Switches are link layer devices
    - Stores and forwards ethernet frames
    - Examines frame header and selectively forwards frame based on MAC dest address
- Transparent
    - Hosts are unaware of presence of switches
- Plug-and-play, self-learning
    - *Switches do **not** need to be configured!*
    - Helps to determine which frames should be forwarded to which LAN segments (links)

Self-Learning
- A switch has a **switch table**
- Entry in switch table:
    - (MAC Address, Interface, TTL)
    - Stale entries in table dropped (TTL can be 60min)
- Switch *learns* which hosts can be reached through which interfaces
    - When frames received, switch "learns" location of sender through incoming LAN segment
    - Records sender/location pair in switch table
- If given a frame that the switch does not know the address to, send to all other ports of the switch other than the one the frame arrived from
