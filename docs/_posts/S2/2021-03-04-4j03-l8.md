Packet Switching
===

Recall...
- Directly connected networks
    - Shared medium connectivity (WLAN, Ethernet)
- Limitations
    - Number of hosts (eg. $O(100)$)
    - Geographical area
- Next Goal?
    - Communication between hosts that are not directly connected

Switching
- Using network devices connecting multiple direct link networks
- Scale
    - Direct link networks: $O(100)$ hosts
    - Packet-switched network: $O(100 000)$ hosts
- Recursive definition of a communication network
    - One network can be built as a connection of nodes, and the links to connect them
    - Each node can be seen as either another network or a physical device
        - Allows us to recursively define a network

Network Devices
- Physical layer
    - **Repeater**: Relay communication signal
    - **Hub**: Multi-port repeater
- Data link layer
    - **Bridge**: Repeater and add-on functions
    - **Switch**: Multi-port bridge
        - Repeater and hub for data link layer essentially
- Network layer
    - **Router**: Connecting LAN and internet
    - **Gateway**: Connecting heterogeneous networks

Bridges and LAN Switching
===

Bridges: Building Extended LAN's
- Traditional LAN
    - Shared medium (eg. ethernet)
    - Cheap and easy to administer
    - Supports broadcast traffic
- Problem
    - Scale LAN concept
        - Larger geographic area ($\gt O(1 km)$)
        - More hosts ($\gt O(100)$)
    - **But** retain LAN-like functionality
- Solution: **Bridges**
- Uses and Limitations of Bridges
    - Bridges
        - Extend LAN concept
        - Increase bandwidth (achieving ***n* times** of bandwidth, where *n* is # of ports)
        - Limited scalability (to $O(1000)$ hosts, not to global networks)
- Bridge outline
    - Learning bridges
    - Spanning tree algorithm

Learning Bridges
- Trivial algorithm
    - Forward all frames on all (other) LANs
    - Potentially heavy traffic and processing overhead
- Optimize by using address information
    - "Learn" which hosts live on which LAN
    - Maintain forwarding table
    - Only forward when necessary
    - Reduce bridge workload
- Bridge learns table entries based on source address
    - When receive frame from *A* on port 1, add *A* to list of hosts on port 1
    - Time out entries to allow movement of hosts  
- Always forward broadcast frames
- Examples using the given table:
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/brex.PNG) 
    - Frame for *A* received on port 1
        - The bridge does nothing
    - Frame for *C* received on port 2
        - The bridge forwards the frame to port 1
    - Frame for *S* received on port 2
        - The bridge forwards the frame to port 1 (since position unknown, keep on all ports)
- Problem: If there is a loop in the extended LAN, a packet could circulate forever
    - Side question: Are loops good or bad?
- Loops
    - Adds robustness (removes single points of failure)
    - Complicates learning/forwarding
- Solution
    - Create a spanning tree to eliminate unnecessary edges
- Example of an extended LAN with loops:
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/loop.PNG) 

Spanning Tree Algorithm
- View extended LAN as a **"bipartite graph"**
    - LANs are graph nodes
    - Bridges are also graph nodes
    - Ports are edges connecting LANs to bridges
- Objective: Obtain a spanning tree which connects all LANs
- Basic Rules:
    - Bridge with the lowest ID is the **root**
    1. Select all the ports to directly connected to the root to get a set of LANs
    2. From these LANs, select ports directly connected to them to reach bridges which have not been reached from root yet
    3. From these bridges, select ports to reach all LANs which have not been reached from root yet
    - Go to Step 2 until all the LANs have been reached
    - NOTE: **Leaf-node bridges and the edges connecting them are not part of the spanning tree**
- Example of creating a spanning tree:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/spex.PNG) 
- **Forwarding**: Each bridge forwards frames using ports in the spanning tree
- **Suppressing**: A bridge does not forward a frame over a port if it knows that the destination is not on that side of the port

Distributed Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Bridges exchange configuration messages in the form $(Y, d, X)$
    - *Y*: Root node
    - *d*: Distance to root node
    - *X*: Originating node
- Each bridge records current best configuration message for each port
- Initially, each bridge believes it is the root
- Bridges update the configuration message upon receiving the configuration message from other bridges
- Bridges periodically send configuration messages
    - A timeout is used to restart the algorithm
- Example for the following at bridge B3  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/spaex.PNG) 
    1. B3 receives (B2, 0, B2)
    2. Since, 2 < 3, B3 accepts B2 as root
    3. B3 adds one to the distance advertised by B2 and sends (B2, 1, B3)
    4. B2 accepts B1 as root and sends (B1, 1, B2)
    5. B5 accepts B1 as root and sends (B1, 1, B5)
    6. B3 accepts B1 as root and stops forwarding
- Limitations of Bridges
    - **Does not Scale**: Spanning tree algorithm scales linearly, need for more messages to be sent around
    - **Does not Accommodate Heterogeneity**: Networks bust have the same address format (eg. Ethernet-to-Ethernet)

Forwarding with Virtual Circuits
- Connection-oriented
    - Requires explicit setup and teardown
    - Packets follow established route
    - **Virtual Circuit (VC) Table** stores connection state
- Why support connections in a network?
    - Useful for service notions
    - Important for telephony
- Switch
    - (Incoming Port, Incoming VCI) uniquely identifies VC
    - Translates virtual circuit ID on incoming link to virtual circuit ID on outgoing link
    - Circuit IDs can be per-link or per-switch
- Setup
    - A virtual circuit identifier (VCI) is assigned to the circuit for each link it traverses
    - VCI is **locally significant**
    - (Incoming Port, Incoming VCI) uniquely identifies VC
- Switch
    - Maintains a translation table from (Incoming Port, Incoming VCI) to (Outgoing Port, Outgoing VCI)
- Two types of VCs
    - **Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC)**: Long-lived
    - **Switch Virtual Circuits (SVC)**: Uses signalling to establish VC
- A simple example setup protocol
    - Each host and switch maintains per-link local variable for VCI assignment
    - When setup frame leaves host/switch
        - Assign outgoing VCI
        - Increment assignment counter
    - Port and circuit ID combination is unique
    - Switches maintain translation table from:
        - Incoming Port/VCI pair to
        - Outgoing Port/VCI pair
- Assumptions
    - Circuits are "simplex"
    - On a duplex link, the same VCI can be used for two circuits, one in each direction
    - The same VCI can be used on different ports of the same switch
    - At setup, the lowest available VCI is used
- Example of forwarding and VCI values:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/portex.PNG)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/portex2.PNG) 
- Analogous to a game of following a sequence of clues
- Advantages
    - Header (for a data packet) requires only virtual circuit ID
        - Connection request contains global address
    - Can reserve resources at setup time
- Disadvantages
    - Typically must wait one RTT for setup
    - Cannot dynamically avoid failures, must reestablish connection
    - Global address path information still necessary for connection setup

Forwarding with Source Routing
- Packet header specifies directions
    - One absolute direction per switch, with port name and next switch name
    - Switches may delete or rotate directions within packet headers
- Example with source routing:
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4j03/srouex.PNG) 
    - The last packet did not know where *H* was, so the wrong directions were given and a failure occurred
- Analogous to following directions
- Advantages
    - Simple switches
    - Fast and cheap
- Disadvantages
    - Host must know entire topology
    - Changes must propagate to all hosts
    - Headers might get large
