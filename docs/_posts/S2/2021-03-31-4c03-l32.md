Cryptography Cont.
===

Symmetric Key Crypto: DES
- **DES: Data Encryption Standard**
- US encryption standard [NIST 1993]
- 56-bit symmetric key, 64-bit plaintext input
- How secure is DES?
    - Not very, was broken in 22h 15m in January 1999
- Making DES more secure
    - Use three keys sequentially (3-DES) on each datum
    - Use cipher-block chaining

AES: Advanced Encryption Standard**
- New (Nov 2001) symmetric-key NIST standard, replacing DES
- Processes data in 128 bit blocks, with 128/192/256 bit keys
- If brute force decryption (try each key) taking 1 sec on DES, takes 149 trillion years for AES
    - Currently no known practical attack on AES when correctly implemented

Symmetric Key Cryptography
- Bob and Alice share the same (symmetric) key: $K_{A-B}$
    - eg. Key is knowing substitution pattern in mono alphabetic substitution cipher

- Q: How do Bob and Alice agree on a key value?
    - **Key Distribution Center**
        - Alice, Bob need shared symmetric key
        - KDC: Server shares different secret key with *each* registered user (many users)
        - Alice, Bob known own symmetric keys, $K_{A-KDC}, K_{B-KDC}$ for communicating with KDC
        - Can change per session, dynamic, known as **session key**
    - **Diffe-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol**
        - Allow Alice and Bob to agree on a shared secret in a public channel (against passive, ie. eavesdropping only adversaries)
        - Setup requires a prime *p* and a base *g*, both public 
        - System:

Diffie-Hellman Example
- Alice and Bob agree on $p = 23, g = 5$
- Alice chooses $a=6$ and sends $5^6 \mod 23 = 8$
- Bob chooses $b = 15$ and sends $5^{15} \mod 23 = 19$
- Alice computes $19^6 \mod 23 = 2$
- Bob computes $8^{15} \mod 23 = 2$
- Then *2* is the shared secret
    - Assumption is that finding $5^x \mod 23 = 8, 5^x \mod 23 = 19$ are hard

Public Key Cryptography
- Key difference is public encryption key known to *all*
- Private decryption key known only to receiver
- Example image (subscript indicates person being talked about, and superscripts indicates public or private)

Public Key Encryption Algorithms
- Requirements:
    1. Need $K_B^+ ()$ and $K_B^- ()$ such that (the reverse is true as well)  
        $$K_B^- (K_B^+ (m)) = m$$  
    2. Given public key $K_B^+$, it should be impossible to compute private key $K_B^-$
- **RSA**: Rivest, Shamir, Alderson Algorithm
    - Most famous public key encryption algorithm, 2002 turing award

RSA: Choosing Keys
1. Choose two large prime numbers $p,q$ (eg. 1024 bits each)
2. Compute $n = pq, z = (p-1)(q-1)$
3. Choose $e$ (with $e \lt n$) that has no common factors with z ($e, z$ are "relatively prime)
4. Choose $d$ such that $ed - 1$ is exactly divisible by $z$ ($ed \mod z = 1$)
5. Public key is $(n,e)$, private key is $(n,d)$

RSA: Encryption and Decryption
- Given $(n,e)$ and $(n,d)$ as computed above...
    1. To encrypt bit pattern, *m*, compute:  
        $$c = m^e \mod n$$
    2. To decrypt received bit pattern *c*, compute:  
        $$m = c^d \mod n$$
- Holds required property:  
    $$m = (m^e \mod d)^d \mod n)$$

RSA Example
- Bob chooses $p = 5, q = 7$, then $n=p*q = 35, z = (p-1) *(q-1) = 24$
    - $e = 5$ (so $e, z$ relative primes)
    - $d = 29$ (so $ed - 1$ exactly divisible by *z*)

Digital Signatures
- Application of public key crypto
    - Cryptographic technique analogous to hand-written signatures
    - Sender (Bob) digitally signs document, establishing he is document owner/creator
    - **Verifiable, nonforgeable**: Recipient (Alice) can prove to someone that Bob, and no one else (including Alice), must have signed the document
- Simple digital signature for message *m*:
    - Bob signs *m* by encrypting with his private key $K_B^-$, creating "signed" message $K_B^- (m)$
    - Alice can verify this signature by checking with his public key, using the following:  
        $$K_B^+ (K_B^- (m)) = m$$
        - Can verify if her decrypted message and that decrypted message matches
    - This shows a possible verification and non-repudiation 

Message Digests
- Computationally expensive to public-key-encrypt long messages
- **Goal:** Fixed-length, easy-to-compute digital "fingerprint"
- Apply hashing AAA (finish)
