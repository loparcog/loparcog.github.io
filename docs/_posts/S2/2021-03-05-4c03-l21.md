NAT, ICMP, and Routing Protocols
===

NAT: Network Address Translation
- Motivation: A private (home) network uses just **one IP address** as far as the outside world is concerned
    - No need to be allocated range of addresses from ISP
    - Can change addresses of devices in a private network without notifying outside world
    - Can change ISP without changing addresses of devices in a private network
    - Devices inside not explicitly addressable by or visible by outside world (a security plus)
- Q: What if I have more hosts than available public IP addresses?

    - Map devices to one public IP and utilize ports to distinguish them
- Implementation: NAT router must...
    - Outgoing datagrams: replace `(source IP address, port #)` of every outgoing datagram to `(NAT IP address, new port #)`
        - Remote clients/servers will respond using `(NAT IP address, new port #)` as destination address
    - Remember (in NAT translation table) every `(source IP address, port #)` to `(NAP IP address, new port #)` translation pair
    - Incoming datagrams: replace `(NAT IP address, new port #)` in destination fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding `(source IP address, port #)` stored in NAT table
- Example NAT process:
    1. Host `10.0.0.1, 3345` sends datagram to `128.119.40.186, 80`
    2. NAT router changes datagram source address from `10.0.0.1, 3345` to `138.76.29.7, 5001` and updates the table to store this pair as LAN side addr and WAN side addr, respectively
    3. Reply arrives with destination addr `138.76.29.7, 5001`
    4. NAT router changes datagram destination addr from `138.76.29.7, 5001` to `10.0.0.1, 3345`
- 16-bur port-number field
    - \> 60 000 simultaneous connections with a single LAN-side address
- NAT is controversial though
    - Routers should only process up to layer 3
    - Violates the end-to-end argument
        - NAT possibility must be taken into account by app designers, eg. P2P apps
    - Address shortage should ideally be solved by IPv6

ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
- Used by hosts and routers to communicate network-level information
    - **Error reporting**: Unreachable host, network, port, protocol, etc.
    - **Status check**: Echo request/reply (used by ping)
- Network-layer "above" IP
    - ICMP msgs carried in IP datagrams, protocol 1
- ICMP message: type, code plus first 8 bytes of IP datagram causing error

- Q: What ICMP messages to you use for traceroute?
- Source sends series of UDP segments to dest
    - First has TTL = 1
    - Second has TTL = 2, etc.
    - Unlikely port number
- When *n*th datagram arrives to *n*th router
    - Router discards datagram
    - Sends to source an ICMP message (type 11, code 0)
    - Message includes name of router and IP address
- When ICMP message arrives, source calculates RTT
    - Traceroute does this 3 times
- Stopping criterion
    - UDP segment eventually arrives at destination host
    - Destination returns ICMP "dest port unreachable" packet (type 3, code 3)
    - When source gets this ICMP, stop

Routing Protocols
===

Routing Protocols
- Routing protocols are implemented on the routers of a network
    - Establish paths between nodes
- Network modelled as a graph
    - Routers are graph vertices
    - Links are edges
    - Edges have associated "cost" (eg. distance, loss, latency)
- Goal: Compute a "good" path from source to destination
    - "Good" usually means shortest/least cost path

Graph Abstraction
- Graph: $G = (N, E)$
- $N$: Set of routers = $(A, B, C, D, E, F)$
- $E$: Set of links = $((A,B), (A,D), (B,D), ...)$
- Cost of path $(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_p)$:  
    $$= c(x_1, x_2) + c(x_2, x_3) + ... + c(x_{p-1}, x_p)$$
    - eg. Cost of path $(B, D, A)$

A Link-State Routing Algorithm
- Implement **Dijkstra's algorithm**
    - Net topology, link costs **known to all nodes**
        - Accomplished via "link state broadcast"
        - All nodes have same info
    - Computes least cost paths **from one node** (source) to all other nodes
        - Gives forwarding table for that node
    - **Iterative**: After *k* iterations, know least cost path to *k* destinations
- Notation:
    - $c(x,y)$: Link cost from node *x* to *y*, $\infty$ if not direct neighbors
    - $D(v)$: Current value of cost of path from source to destination *v*
    - $p(v)$: Predecessor node along path from source to *v*
    - $N'$: Set of nodes whos lease cost path definitively known
- Pseudo code:
