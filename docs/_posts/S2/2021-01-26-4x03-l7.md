Gauss Elimination
===

Gauss Elimination
- For a given matrix of *a* values
    - Multiply the first row by $a_{2,1}/a_{1,1}$ and subtract from row 2
    - Multiply the first row by $a_{3,1}/a_{1,1}$ and subtract from row 3
    - Continue until all first column vals are 0's except for first row
    - Repeat for each column until you have an upper triangle matrix
- Code algorithm:

- Third nested for loop executes $n-k$ times, with $n-k$ multiplications and $n-k$ additions
- The work per iteration of the second nested for loop is $2(n-k) + 1$
    - The $+1$ comes from the division
    - This loop also executes $n-k$ times
- Total work for the second nested for loop is $2(n-k)^2 + (n-k)$
- Total cost for the outermost for loop of the alg is:   
    $$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}[2(n-k)^2+(n-k)] = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k$$
- These sums can then get us the **total work** of the Gauss Elimination as:
    $$\frac{2}{3} n^3 + O(n^2)$$

Backwards Substitution
- After GE, we have:

    - We know from this that
        $$x_n = b_n / a_{n,n}$$
        We can then go to get
        $$x_{n-1} = (b_{n-1} - a_{n-1,n} x_n)/a_{n-1,n-1}$$
    - This gives us the general equation  
        $$x_k = (b_k - \sum_{j = k+1}^n a_{k,j}x_j)/a_{k,k}$$
- The work per iteration is
    - $n-k$ multiplications
    - $(n - k - 1) + 1$ additions
    - 1 division
    - Total $2(n-k) + 1$ operations
- Total work is then given as
    $$\sum_{k=1}^n (2(n-k) + 1) = n^2$$
    (Full work in slides)
- Total work **with gaussian elimination** is then given as $O(n^3)$
