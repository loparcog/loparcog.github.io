Internet Finish, Internet Architecture & Design Start

Recall...
- **Nodal Delay**  
    $$d_{nodal} = d_{proc} + d_{queue} + d_{trans} + d_{prop}$$
- $d_{proc}$: Processing delay (typically a few microseconds or less)
- $d_{queue}$: Queueing delay (depends on the level of network loads)
- $d_{trans}$: Transmission delay (L/R, significant for low-speed links)
- $d_{prop}: Propagation delay (a few microseconds to hundreds of msecs)

Example
- Houston sends a message of 50 000 bytes to Mark on Mars over a radio link at speed 1Kbps. The distance between Mars and Earth are the orbital closet distance of 56 million km
    - NOTE: K**b**ps = bits, K**B**ps = bytes 
- Q: How long does it take for the message to reach Mark from Houston (HINT: Ignore processing and queueing delay, the speed of light is $3*10^8$)
    - SOLN:  
    We know transmission delay is length of the packet divided by the link speed:  
        $$d_{trans} = (50000*8)/1000 = 400s$$  
    Furthermore, the propagation delay is the distance divided by the speed of transmission in the medium (speed of light):  
        $$d_{prop} = 56*10^9 / 3 *10^8 = 186s$$  
    Therefore, our total delay is **586s**

Example 2
- Houston sends a message of 50 000 bytes to Mark on Mars over a radio link at speed 1Kbps. The distance between Mars and Earth are the orbital **furthest** distance of **140 million km** apart
- Q: How long does it take for the message to reach Mark from Houston (HINT: Ignore processing and queueing delay, the speed of light is $3*10^8$)
    - SOLN:  
    Transmission delay will be the same:  
        $$d_{trans} = 400s$$  
    But now, the propagation delay will be:  
        $$d_{prop} = 140 * 10^9 / 3 * 10^8$$  
    Compute and solve

Packet Losses
- Transmission links can be unreliable
    - Bit error rate of ~$10^{-6}$ in radios, and $10^{-15}$ over optical
- Queues (or buffers) have finite capacity
    - When a packet arrives to a full queue, the packet is dropped/lost (which one is dropped? Depends on system)
- Lost packets may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not retransmitted at all
    - Task of a reliable end-packet will be left to the end system

Internet Architecture & Design
===

Internet Protocols
- **Protocols** control sending/receiving of messages
    - eg. TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11
- Internet standards exist for these protocols
    - RFC: Request for Comments
    - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
- What is a protocol?
    - Protocols define **format, order of messages sent/received** among network entities, and **actions taken** on message transmission, receipt (eg. TCP, IP, HTTP, FTP, PPP, ICMP)
    - Like a conversation between people, rules and standards usually followed for polite conversations
- Protocol "Layers"
    - Networks are complex, with many "pieces" like hosts, routers, links of various media, applications, protocols, and hardware/software
        - How to manage all of thses
    - Management done through **layering**, grouping common systems together
    - Example could be top application layer for SMTP, SSH, and FTP, followed by a transmission media layer for things like coaxial cables and fiber optics
        - Each application needs to interface with **all** existing transmission media
        - Adding a new application would be $O(m)$ work, where *m* is the number of transmission medias
        - Likewise, adding a new media would be $O(a)$ work, where *a* is the number of applications  
    - This example can be seen below:  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/lay.PNG)
    - Total work in system would be $O(ma)$, would become too large to manage over time
- The above would be far too much work to get going, how do we fix?
    - We can add an **intermediate layer**, providing a single abstraction for various network technologies
    - Would only require $O(1)$ work to add an app or a media
    - Indirection is an often used technique in computer science

Network Architecture
- Architecture is not the implementation itself, but how to "organize" implementations
    - *What* interfaces are supported and *where* functionality is implemented
    - Main focus on modular design of the network
- Many similarities between software and network modularity  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/mod.PNG)
- Key difference is choosing **where** modules are implemented in networks

Layering
- Laying is a particular form of **modularization**, breaking the system down into a **vertical hierarchy** of logically distinct entities (layers)
- Rigid structure: easy for reuse, but performance may suffer  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/layer.PNG)
- Key concepts of layering
    - **Service**: Says what a layer does
        - Ethernet: Unreliable subnet unicast/multicast/broadcast datagram service
        - IP: Unreliable end-to-end unicast datagram service
        - TCP: Reliable end-to-end bi-directional byte stream service
    - **Service Interface**: Says how to access the service
        - eg. Socket interface
    - **Protocol**: Says how the service is implemented
        - A set of rules and message formats that govern the communication between two peers

Internet Protocol Architecture
- The **TCP/IP protocol suite** is the basis for the networks that we call The Internet
- The TCP/IP suite has four layers: **Application, Transport, Network, and (Data) Link Layer**
- **Computers (hosts)** implement all four layers
    - **Routers** (gateways) only have the bottom two layers and some network devices have implemented by the bottom layers  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipa.PNG)
- Example of layering in action:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/lia.PNG)
- Each layer adds their own header information onto the message to help it be received and read by the end system
