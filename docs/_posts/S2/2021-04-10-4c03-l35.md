VPNs and IPsec
===

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/vpns.PNG)

IPsec Services
- Data integrity
- Origin authentication
- Replay attack prevention
- Confidentiality

IPsec
- **Tunnelling Mode**: Edge routers and hosts are IPsec-aware  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipst.PNG)
- **Transport Mode**: IPsec datagram emitted and received by end-system; protects upper level protocols

IPsec Protocols
- **IKE/IKEv2**: Provides a framework for policy negotiation and key management
    - Security associations (SAs)
- **Authentication Header (AH) Protocol**: Provides source authentication and data integrity, but **not** confidentiality
- **Encapsulation Security Protocol (ESP)**: Provides source authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality
    - More widely used than AH
- AH and ESP can be used both in host and tunnel mode, but most popular is **Tunnel mode with ESP**

Security Associations (SAs)
- Before sending data, "**Security Association (SA)**" established from sending to receiving entity
    - SAs are **simplex**: for **only one direction**
- Ending, receiving entities maintain state information about SA
    - Recall: TCP endpoints also maintain state info
    - IP is connectionless; IPsec is **connection-oriented**!
- How many SAs in VPN w/ headquarters, branch office, and *n* travelling salespeople?

- Example SA from *R1* to *R2*:

Security Association Database (SAD)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sad.PNG)
- Assume...
    - Endpoint holds SA state **in security association database (SAD)**, where it can locate them during processing
    - One bi-directional IPsec traffic between headquarters and the branch office
        - 2 SAs
    - One bi-directional IPsec traffic between headquarters and each salesperson
        - With *n* salespersons, $2n$ SAs in *R1*'s SAD
    - When sending IPsec datagram, *R1* accesses SAD to determine how to process datagram
    - When IPsec datagram arrives to *R2*, *R2* examines SPI in IPsec datagram, indexes SAD with SPI, and processes datagram accordingly

IPsec Datagram
- Focus for now on **tunnel mode with ESP**:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipd.PNG)
- *R1*: Convert original datagram to IPsec datagram
    - Appends to back of original datagram (which includes original header fields!) and "ESP trailer" field
    - Encrypts result using algorithm and key specified by SA
    - Appends to front of this encrypted quantity the ESP header, creating "enchilada"
    - Creates authentication MAC over the whole enchilada, using algorithm and key specified in SA
    - Appends MAC to back of enchilada, forming a payload
    - Creates brand new IP header, with all the classic IPv4 header fields, which it appends before payload
- Inside the enchilada
    - ESP trailer: Padding for block ciphers
    - ESP header
        - SPI, so receiving entity knows what to do
        - Sequence number, to thwart replay attacks
    - MAC in ESP auth field is created with shared secret key

IPsec Sequence Numbers
- For new SA, sender initializes sequence number to 0
- Each time a datagram is sent on SA:
    - Sender increments seq # counter
    - Places values in seq # field
- Goal:
    - Prevent attacker from sniffing and replaying a packet
    - Receipt of duplicate, authenticated IP packets may disrupt service
- Method:
    - Destination checks for duplicates
    - Doesn't keep track of all received packets, instead uses a window

Security Protocol Database (SPD)
- **Policy**: For a given datagram, sending entity needs to know if it should use IPsec
- Needs also to know which SA to use
    - May use: source and destination IP address; protocol number
- Info in SPD indicates "what" to do with arriving datagram
- Info in SAD indicates "how" to do it
