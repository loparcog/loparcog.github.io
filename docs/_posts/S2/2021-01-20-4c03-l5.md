Recall...
- Internet Protocol Architecture
    - The **TCP/IP protocol suite** is the basis for the networks that we call The Internet
    - The TCP/IP suite has four layers: **Application, Transport, Network, and (Data) Link Layer**
    - **Computers (hosts)** implement all four layers
        - **Routers** (gateways) only have the bottom two layers and some network devices have implemented by the bottom layers

    - Example of layering in action:  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/lia.PNG)
    - Each layer adds their own header information onto the message to help it be received and read by the end system

Services of the Layers
- **Application**: Supporting network applications (FTP, SMTP, HTTP)
- **Transport**: Process-to-process data transfer (TCP, UDP)
- **Network**: Routing of datagrams from source to destination (IP, Routing protocols)
- **Link**: Data transfer between neighboring network elements (Ethernet, 802.11 (WiFi), PPP)
    - Note: Usage of each layer varies for different applications/uses
- Further layering example:

- Layering is a convenient way to think about networks, but is not always followed rigorously
    - **Middle-boxes**: Firewalls, network address translation
    - Cross layer optimization

The Internet Design Question
- Support for common services (for diverse applications)
    - Reliability?
    - In-order delivery?
    - Guaranteed bandwidth?
    - Low latency?
    - Accountability?
    - Security?
- What functionalities should be supported?
- Where should the functionality be placed?
- Two design principles
    - In fact it's just one, but from different perspective
    - At the network core: **the hourglass model**
    - From the end system's point of view: **end-to-end argument**
- **The Hourglass Model**
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hglass.PNG)
    - Lots of diversity at top and bottom of the stack, but we want something that remains constant for communication
    - That is where the "waist" comes in, allowing everything to communicate through a common medium like IP, to ensure new technologies work with old ones
    - A single internet layer module
    - Allows all networks to **interoperate**
        - All network technologies that support IP can exchange packets
    - Allows all applications to function on all networks
        - All appliucation that can run on IP can use any network
    - Simultaneous developments above and below IP
    - **Router implementation simplified**
- **The End-to-End Argument**
    - Leave it to the end-hosts, if implementing this functionality to the network:
        1. Doesn't reduce host implementation complexity
        2. Does increase network complexity
        3. Probably imposes delay and overhead on all applications, even if they don't need the functionality
    - Essentially options are implementing functionality in the network or in the end-hosts
- Case Study
    1. Reliability: Message is correctly and eventually delivered from application process on the source to the destination host
        - This would not reduce host implementation complexity
        - This would greatly increase network complexity
        - It can impose delay and overhead for applications that don't need it
            - Therefore this **should not** be left to the end-hosts
        - However, implementing this in the network can 
    2. Data Privacy: Application data should remain private (not visible to 3rd parties)
        - Add additional layer for privacy, not reduce complexity
        - Same network complexity
        - Would impose delay/overhead
            - Therefore this **should not** be left to the end-hosts
