Music Therapy in NICU
===

What is NICU?
- **Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)** specializes in the care of ill/premature newborn infants
    - Neonatal refers to the first 28 days of life
    - A premature baby is born before 37 completed weeks of gestation (more than 3 weeks before the due date)
- Going to focus on premature infants for this course

Development of MT in NICU
- Music research began in the NICU over 25 years ago
- Medical staff resisted the idea that music therapy could impact premature infant medical outcomes
- Today, NICU-MT is well known in the U.S., not in Canada
- Specialty training in US, over 300 specially trained Board Certified MTs (MT-BCs)
- Over 50 research studies in refereed journals provide evidence-based methodology for NICU-MT and document important and unique infant benefits from music
    - Results primarily physiological

How can Babies Engage in MT?
- The two video-links posted provide different examples
    - Listening (sucking to turn on music)
    - Entraining (breathing/heart rate)
    - Making noise

Premature Infants: Perspectives on NICU-MT Practice (Article)
- Jayne M. Standley, published in "Voices Journal"
    - Journal of World Music Therapy Association (WMTA)

Family-Centred Care
- In 2004, a survey of NICU nurses in the US demonstrated that 68% wanted music included in NICU treatment
- Individualized developmental and family-centred care
- Just as important to support the parent(s)?
    - Yes, lots of uncertainty and anxiety with premature birth, such as plans with last day at work, plans for supports to come, etc.
    - Stress will be felt by infant, and also the child needs to stay in the hospital to be watched, causing further stress for the mom/family members

Training to Work as a MT in NICU?
- A formalized NICU-MT training program exists in the US (not needed in Canada as it does not exist)
    - The National Institute for Infant and Child Medical Music Therapy, approved by the Certification Board for Music Therapy as a continuing education provider, conducts the program through an affiliation of four universities and five medical centers
    - Training in three phases and consists of a minimum of eight hours of lecture, 16 hours of hands on training in an affiliated NICU, and completion of online tests for two text books
    - Hundreads of US and international music therapists have been trained, including people from England, Spain, Norway, Japan, etc.

Can Music be Dangerous?
- Problems occur when music is used in the NICU setting without expertise
- Volunteer musicians seek opportunities to perform in the NICU without knowing the consequences of overstimulation or how to use music to the greatest benefit
- Parents or other professionals sometimes bring toys or mobiles into the NICU environment with auditory components (eg. lullabies, heartbeats) without understanding the consequences for their own or nearby infants
    - Problems with overstimulation and volume
- Things can be made for infants but be bad for *premature* infants

Primary Critical Variables Measures
- **Physiological Measures**: Heart rate, respiration rate, weight gain, oxygen saturation, days in hospital, apnea, bradycardia, etc.
- **Developmental/Behavioural Milestones**: Behaviour state, ability to transition from state to state or self-soothe, feeding skill, and caregiver/infant attachment
    - In video, sucking on pacifier gave no food but would produce a music sound to encourage sucking behaviour, an example of a behavioural approach
- In order to clarify benefits of specific procedures, the music used should **be fully described** with careful attention to content, complexity, duration, and decibel (dB) level
    - See Standley & Walworth, 2010

Live or Recorded Music
- Research shows that music is effective in multiple ways, whether live or recorded
- Life music is the preference of the profession
    - However, there are too many premature infants for their needs to be fully met by the limited number of MTs available to provide services

Three Stages of Developmental Care of Premature Infants
1. Survival/pacification
2. Cautious stimulation
3. Transition to interactive stimulation

Stage 1: Survival/Pacification
- No touching, interaction, or disturbance of sleep
- Live or recorded music, with the fewest alerting stimuli possible
    - Very consistent and calm
- The therapist's face should be more than 10" from the infant to not overstimulate them
- Research in this area has shown that quiet, consistent music (less than 65 db, in scale of C) soothes, masks averse auditory stimuli, and enhance medical indicators of infant wellbeing like oxygen saturation
- Use of lullabies in the child's native language simultaneously promotes language development while pacifying and are specifically designed to soothe and quiet infants

Stage 2: Cautious Stimulation
- Touch and interaction is permitted
    - Mom can hold their child, remove from incubator
    - When removal from the incubator is permitted, then kangaroo care (skin-to-skin contact with the infant, lying quietly on the caregiver's bare chest) is highly beneficial and can only be provided by the primary caregivers
- Music listening during passive touch such as kangaroo care is beneficial
- Methods to elicit infant interaction with the parent or therapist are off limits until the infant can tolerate minimal stimulation
- Gender differences in response to this technique show males respond better to a capella voice if touch is applied, where females respond better to greater complexity such as guitar accompaniment for voice combined with touch
    - Example of where training in this group is highly needed (when to sing with/without instrument, when to touch, when to touch and sing, etc.)

Stage 3: Transition to Interactive Stimulation
- Music listening after distressing medical procedures to return the infant to a sleep state
- Infant must coordinate suck/swallow/breathe ability and build endurance for feeding indicated by satisfactory weight gain
    - Music reinforces sucking and facilitates oral feeding ability
- Systematic multi-modal stimulation is highly effective in promoting neurologic maturation that is evidenced by tolerance to the combined stimuli of touch, singing, and movement
- Infant must orient to and track visual and auditory stimuli
    - Music is an excellent cue for initiating tracking ability
