MatLab
===

MatLab Intro
- Can use MatLab or Octave, either is fine
- Variables
    - Case-sensitive, same as most other languages
    - All variables are actually **matrices**, even single integer values
    - Variables are not statically typed, so variables can change types whenever
    - Can declare a row as `[1,2,3]`, and a two row variable as `[1,2;3,4]`
        - Can also make arrays using command structure `<start val>:<iterator>:<end val>`, ex:
            ```
            x = 0: pi/6 : 2*pi
            ```
- Operators
    - Since values are in matrices, you need to follow matrices addition and multiplication rules
    - Division has four types:
        - Right Division `A/B`: $A * \inv(B)$
        - Left Division `A\B`: $\inv(A) * B$
        - Element-wise right division `./`
        - Element-wise left division `.\`
    - Some seem arbitrary but very useful for optimization
        - Will be marked on optimizing code!
    - Common operators like `abs`, `sin`, etc. all also exist
        - Idea was to make it so a line would look like a regular function on paper
    - Single-operand commands applied to matrices will be applied to all elements
    - Can clear screen using `clr`, and all variables using `clear`
        - To avoid clearing a given variable, use `clearvars -except <varname>`

Plotting
- Can plot data in graphical format
- Plotting commands
    - `figure(n)`: Start a new plot, mainly used for dividing commands for two plots
    - `plot(x, y, ...)`: Plot the x values on the x-axis and the y-values on the y-axis
        - Can take more arguments for more graphs, each with their following x and y values
    - `xlabel 'x'`: Make a label for the x-axis
    - `ylabel 'y'`: Make a label for the y-axis
    - `title 'val'`: Make a title
    - `legend('graph 1', ...)`: Make a legend for all lines on the graph
    - `grid on`: Turn on gridlines on your plot
- Plots are very dynamic, can update while they are on

Conditionals
- There is also conditional loops, like `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, etc.
