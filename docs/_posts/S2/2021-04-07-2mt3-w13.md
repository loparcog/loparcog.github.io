Music Therapy and Parkinson's Disease
===

What is PD? (Video)
- Estimated 600 000 to 1 million or more in US are living with PD
    - 60 000 diagnosed each year
- Increases by age, but can occur at 40 or younger
    - Like dementia, not a **result** of ageing, and different since many younger people can get it
- No main tests for PD, mainly look for resting tremor, stiffness, and slowness of movement
    - Usually think of hand shaking, but can also be walking and balance problems
    - Can also cause other things like loss of sense of smell, depression, stomach issues, etc.
- Same idea of if you've met one person with parkinsons, you've met one person with parkinsons
    - Very diverse conditions and symptoms, no standard trajectory or path
- Dopamine producing cells dying results in PD
- Thought to be result of genetic and environmental factors
    - Note vast majority not connected to genetics though, and head injuries and other things can increase chance
- How do we treat PD?
    - Current medicine cannot slow or stop progression, but can ease symptoms
    - Individual treatment plans needed, since cases so different

What is PD (Slides)
- A chronic progressive neurological disorder involving degeneration of the dopaminergic system
- Motor and non-motor symptoms
    - Common aspect is the motor aspect

Best MT Model or Approach
- Think about approaches we have discussed in the course so far
- Which approaches and interventions could be beneficial for symptoms of PD?
    - Neurologic music therapy can help with movement
    - Psychodynamic approaches can help with symptoms of depression and other emotional hardships
        - In Canada, first and foremost help is medication for motor, looking for emotional goals id far down the list
    - Impovisation can be useful, fluid motions paired with music often become void of symptoms
    - Can additionally use lyrical analysis and songwriting to explore feelings about PD
- Most likely a neurologic or phychodynamic-informed approach, but as known, there is no *best* model or approach
    - Use ones for give goals

Music Therapy and PD
- Use music to strengthen breath support and vocal movements
- Also help with fine motor skills
- In example there is a group, but can also be individual depending on goals and person
- Other therapies in addition to pharmisuiticals seems to help, MT being one of those

Outcome of Textbook Articles
- Looking at articles that explored the use of MT as an intervention for the symptoms of PD
- 137 articles, 27 of them met criteria to be reviewed
    - 20 @ motor symptoms (16/20 +)
    - 9 @ non-motor symptoms (7/9 +)
    - 8 @ QoL (6/8 +)
- MT interventions...
    - No exclusions in search
    - Passive (patient/client receives without any outward engagement, like MT playing music that has meaning for the client) and active (improv, music therapy, etc.)
- However, non-english-first-language reports excluded entirely, also reviews, case reports, and letters to the editor
- Classified into three categories:
    1. Melodic music
    2. Signing
    3. Rhythm (no melodic sound)
- Summary
    - A large range of study designs
    - Examples of interventions
    - All examples of music therapy?
    - Measures (survey of symptoms, physiological measures, etc.)
    - Supports the use of MT as part of treatment plans for PD
