Web and HTTP
===

Review
- Web pages consist of objects
- Objects can be an HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file, etc.
- Web page consists of base HTML-file, which includes several referenced objects
- Each object is addressable by a **uniform request identifier (URI)**, eg. `www.someschool.edu/someDept/pic.gif`
    - In the example, `www.someschool.edu` is the host name, and `someDept/pic.gif` is the path name
    - Note: URL includes the identifier and the protocol, whereas URI is just the object

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- Web's application layer protocol
- Client/server model
    - **Client**: Browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and "displays" web objects
    - **Server**: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests
- **TCP**
    - Client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, **port 80**
    - Server attempts TCP connection from client
    - HTTP messages (application-layer protocol) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and web server (HTTP server)
    - TCP connection closed
- HTTP is "stateless"
    - Server maintains no information about past client requests
    - Protocols that do maintain state are quite complex
- **Non-Persistent HTTP**
    - **At most one object** sent over TCP connection
        - Connection then closed
    - HTTP/1.0 uses non-persistent HTTP
    - Typically multiple TCP connections
    - Example: Suppose user enters a given URL, with text and references to 10 jpeg images
        1. HTTP client initiates TCP connection to HTTP server (process) at the host on port 80
        2. HTTP server at host waiting for TCP connection at port 80, "accepts" connection and notifies client
        3. HTTP client sends HTTP **request message** (containing URL) into TCP connection socket, message indicates that the client wants object at the URL
        4. HTTP server receives request message, forms **response message** containing requested object, and sends message into its socket
            - Time between sending request message and getting a response message is **1 Round Trip Time (RTT)**
        5. HTTP server closes TCP connection
        6. HTTP client receives response message containing HTML file, displays HTML. Parsing HTML file finds 10 referenced jpeg objects
        7. Steps 1-6 repeat for each of the 10 JPEG objects (in parallel)
    - Looks like high overhead but advantage in retrieving multiple objects in parallel
- **Persistent HTTP**
    - **Multiple objects** can be sent over a single TCP connection between client/server
    - HTTP/1.1 uses persistent connections in default mode
    - Example: Suppose user enters a given URL, with text and references to 10 jpeg images
        1. HTTP client initiates TCP connection to HTTP server (process) at the host on port 80
        2. HTTP server at host waiting for TCP connection at port 80, "accepts" connection and notifies client    
        3. HTTP client sends HTTP request message (containing URL) into TCP connection socket, indicating the client wants object `someDepartment/home.index`
        4. HTTP server receives request message, forms response message containing requested object, and sends message into its socket
        5. HTTP client receives response message containing html file, displays html, and finds 10 referenced JPEG objects
        6. Steps 3-5 repeated for each of the 10 jpeg objects (sequentially)
        7. HTTP server closes TCP connection after some time or when the client closes the connection
    - Persistent **without** pipelining
        - Client issues new request only when previous response has been received
        - 1 RTT for each referenced object
    - Persistent **with** pipelining
        - Default in HTTP/1.1
        - Client sends request as soon as it encounters a referred object
        - As little as 1 RTT for **all** referenced objects
- HTTP Request Message
    - ASCII (human-readable format)
    - Request line: method, resource, and protocol version

- Method Types
    - HTTP/1.0
        - `GET`: Request an object specified by the URL
        - `POST`: Request that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request
        - `HEAD`: Ask server to leave requested object out of response (only meta info)
    - HTTP/1.1
        - `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`
        - `PUT`: Uploads file/resource in entity body to path specified in URL field
        - `DELETE`: Deletes resource specified in the URL field
- Uploading Form Input
    - **POST Method**
        - Web page often includes form input
        - Input uploaded to server in entity body:  
            ```
            POST /text/demo_form.asp HTTP1.1
            Host: w3schools.com
            name1=value1&name2=value2
            ```
    - **GET Method**
        - Input (name/value pairs) is uploaded in URL field of request line  
            ```
            /test/demo_form.asp?name1=value1&name2=value2
            ```
    - Comparison
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/gp.PNG)
    - **Security Vulnerabilities**
        - URI in clear-text in GET
        - Attackers can exploit buffer overflow in buggy server software by getting/posting a very long URI
- HTTP Response Message  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/resp.PNG)
    - **Status codes** appear in the 1st line in server-to-client response messages
        - Sample codes include `200 OK` (request succeeded, requested object later in this message), `301 Moved Permanently` (requested object moved, new location specified later in this message), etc.
