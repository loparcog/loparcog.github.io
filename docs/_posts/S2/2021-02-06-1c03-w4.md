Module 5: Variation in Surface Temperature
===

The Sun and the Seasons
- Earth takes an ecliptic path around the sun on a flat plane known as the **ecliptic plane**
    - Takes just over 365 days to travel around the plane, known as the **earth's revolution**
- Earth is closest to the sun in January, at a distance of 147 million km
    - Point known as **perihelion** from greek Peri (near) and Helios (sun)
- Earth is farthest from the sun around July 4th, at a distance of 152 million km
    - Point known as **apphelion** from greek App (away from)
- This change in distance results in a change of radiation intensity of approximately **7%** between the two points
- Earth also spins on its axis as it revolves around the sun
    - Completes one spin every 24h
    - This rotation defines the length of a day
- Earth's axis of rotation is not perpendicular to its orbital or ecliptic plane
    - Instead it's tilted/offset by **23.5 degrees** from the ecliptic plane
    - The northern axis aligns with the star Polaris
- The daily variation in air temperature is controlled by the net radiation (balance between incoming and outgoing solar radiation)
    - When incoming is higher than outgoing, net radiation is positive, heating the earth
        - Air is a poor conductor however, so air is only heated near the ground, creating a convection system to heat higher parts of the system
        - Atmosphere keeps heating past noon, with max temperature around 3:00-5:00 PM
    - When outgoing energy exceeds incoming energy, net radiation is negative
        - Air loses sensible heat to the surface, and air temperature falls
        - Temperature at its coolest just before sunrise
- There are two **solstices** throughout the year
    - **June 21st** (June Solstice): beginning of summer in northern hemisphere, beginning of winter in the southern hemisphere
        - Longest day of the year in the NH, and shortest in the SH
- The **subsolar point** is the latitude where the sun is directly overhead at noon, meaning the angle between the sun's rays and the earth's surface is 90 degrees
    - The subsolar point changes throughout the year
    - On June solstace, the sunsolar point is at a latitude of 23.5 degrees N, also known as the **Tropic of Cancer**
    - The north pole is also directed 23.5 degrees towards the sun
    - There is 24h of daylight in the Arctic Circle and 24h of darkness within the Antarctic Circle
    - **December 22nd** (December Solstice): beginning of winter in NH, beginning of summer in SH
        - Shortest day of the year in NH, longest in SH
        - Subsolar point at 23.5 degrees S, also known as the **Tropic of Capricorn**
        - North pole is directed 23.5 degrees away from the sun
        - 24h of daylight in the Antarctic Circle and 24h of darkness within the Arctic Circle
- The **Circle of Illumination** separates the illuminated and not illuminated parts of the earth
    - Touches the Arctic/Antarctic circles at latitudes of 66.5 degrees N/S on both solstices
- At the **equinoxes**, the subsolar point is at the equator
    - There is no tilt towards or away from the sun, everywhere on earth experiences 12h of daylight
    - Circle of Illumination touches both poles
    - March 21 is the **Vernal Equinox**, beginning of spring in the NH
    - September 22 is the **Eternal Equinox**, beginning of fall in the NH
- As earth revolves around the sun, a particular hemisphere aligns towards/away from the sun, creating solstices and equinoxes
    - On solstices, incoming solar energy is greatest in the hemisphere pointing towards the sun
    - On equinoxes, incoming solar energy is equal in both hemispheres
        - These cause seasonal variations
- Spring in the NH corresponds to the Vernal Equinox of March, when Earth's axis is not tilted towards the sun
- Summer in the NH corresponds to the June Solstice, when Earth's north pole is tilted towards the sun
- Fall in NH to Eternal Equinox of September
- Winter in NH to December Solstice, Earth pointed away

Climate and Latitudes
- Seasons are controlled by solar energy striking the tilted earth, causing seasonal variation in length of daylight and intensity of sunlight on surface
    - The change in insulation is greatest towards the poles, leading to stronger seasonal variations since the angle which the sun's rays strike the surface is less and varies more throughout the year
- Annual insulation and seasonal changes of daily insulation can be used to divide the globe into broad latitude zones
    - Not an absolute system, some local variation
    - Generally there is **greater seasonal change with greater distance from the equator**, broadly corresponding to **major climatic zones**
- The **Equatorial Zones** are home to the earth's rainforests
    - No seasonal cycle, but high annual insulation producing a warm temperature throughout the year
- The **Tropical Zones** are home to world's driest deserts
    - Also no seasonal cycle, but high annual insulation also produces a warm temperature throughout the year
- The **Midlatitude Zones** have sun's hight in the sky varying widely throughout the year
    - Differences in day length between summer and winter are large and therefore seasonal contrasts are quite strong
- The **Subarctic Zones** are mostly covered by evergreen forests
    - Zone marked by extremely large variations in day lengths throughout the year with enormous contrast in insulation from solstice to solstice

The Maritime Effect
- Insulation not only factor that dictates local temperatures
    - Surface layer of a large body of water heats and cools more slowly than land, and can act as a temperature regulator
    - Difference shows up in the **diurnal temperature patterns** of cities close to the ocean compared to landlocked cities
    - Ex. San Francisco climate is moderated by the Pacific and San Francisco Bay
        - It is an example of a **maritime climate**
    - On the other hand, Yuma in Arizona is surrounded by dry desert, with daily temperatures having hot days and cool nights
        - It is an example of a **continental climate**
- What gives large bodies of water the ability to act as a temperature regulator?
    - One factor is that while solar rays strike land and water surfaces equally, the depth of penetration is much lower on land
    - Radiation cannot penetrate deeply into the soil/rock, so heating is concentrated at the surface
    - In water, much of the radiation penetrates below the surface, distributing heat to a substantial depth
- **Heat Capacity** is a measure of the ability of a material to absorb heat
    - How much heat is absorbed as 1 gram of a given substance has it's temperature increased by 1 degree celsius, or one gram calorie per centimetre cubed
    - The equation is given as:  
    $$\text{Heat Capacity} = \text{Density }(g*cm^{-3}) * \text{Specific Heat }(cal * g^{-3})$$
    - **Specific Heat** represents the calories absorbed as the temperature of 1g of material increases by 1 degree ccelsius
- The heat capacity of air is twice that of land, whereas the heat capacity of water is 60 times that of land
    - For a given input of heat, the change in temperature is equal to heat added or the heat capacity
    - Rock/soil have a low heat capacity, requiring less energy to increase their temperature
    - Water has a high heat capacity, requiring much more energy to raise its temperature
        - Same is true for cooling
- Overall, water temperature remains more uniform than land temperature
- Another factor is **mixing by wind**
    - Water is a fluid, so it allows mixing, whereas rock is essentially immobile, preventing mixing
    - In water, the warmer surface water mixes with the cooler depth water to produce a more uniform temperature throughout
    - This mixing is driven by wind generating waves
- Exposed water surfaces are also easily cooled, as water molecules can evaporate, releasing latent heat to their surroundings
    - A water surface will **always** evaporate
    - Land surfaces can also be cooled by evaporation if water exists near the soil surface
        - However, once the land surface dries, evaporation and the loss of latent heat stops

Module 6: Climate Change
===

Impacts of Climate on Humans
- Climate and weather processes have affected humans for many centuries in many different ways
    - Human activities disrupted by floods
    - Prolonged droughts affect crop growth
    - Heavy rainfall on mountains may lead to downslope mass movement, like mud flows, destroying settlements and possibly human life
    - Wildfires can result in loss of timber (important economic resource) and loss of property in regions near dense forests

Anthropogenic Climate Forcing
- Humans also affect climate processes through **anthropogenic climate forcing**, which is a change in climate resulting from human activities at a local to global scale
    - Eg. the change in chemical composition of the atmosphere since 1750, impacting the equilibrium between the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere
- Scientists have been able to reconstruct the conditions of the earth's atmosphere over the past millennia, using different pieces of evidence called **proxies**
    - Concentration of CO2 for the past 100yrs was determined by measuring the concentration of gasses trapped in ice cores from the polar ice caps
    - These gasses are a record of earth's past atmosphere
    - While concentration has been relatively constant for the past 1000 years, there has been a rapid increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 in the past 200 years, leading to an increase in the amount of energy trapped at the earth's surface
        - Additional energy may seem small, but on a planetary scale it is enormous
- Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity in several ways, one of which being the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal
    - Also used for motor vehicles, attributing to CO2 in the atmosphere
    - Deforestation and land clearing also removed important CO2 sinks from earth's surface, leading to its release back into the atmosphere
- Concentration of methane has also followed a similar pattern as CO2 during the same window of time
    - The increase in methane has also increased the energy trapped at the surface
    - Substantial fraction of the increase is due to agriculture becoming more and more important
        - Eg. released by rice paddies

Pollution and Changing Landscape
- Human interactions with other components of the earth also have an impact on climate
    - Landscape modifications and the release of particulates and air pollution lead to a climate response
    - Eg. aerosols can have a direct or indirect impact on climate, the degree of which depends on the source (dust from agricultural activities increase the global albedo)
- **Black Carbon** comes from the combustion of fossil fuels and is produced during the refinement of oil
    - Highly absorbing of incoming solar energy, and therefore traps more energy near earth's surface
- An air pollutant is an unwanted substance injected into the atmosphere from the earth's surface
    - Sulfate is an air pollutant released during the burning of fossil fuels, most notably from coal
        - However, this contributed to climate cooling, rather than warming
        - Concentration of atmospheric sulfate highest over locations of major industrial centers like Central Europe, Eastern North America, and China
- The **(South) Asian Brown Cloud** is a layer of pollution that periodically covers parts of South Asia
    - Appears as a lage brown cloud handing over much of South Asia and the Indian Ocean
- Thick haze can also be seen from space, as shown in image in lecture of the East China Sea on March 4th 1996
    - Haze is probably a mixture of industrial air pollution, dust and smoke, and stretches around 200km wide and 600km long
- The South Asian Brown Cloud is created by a range of airborne particles and pollutants from combustion such as wood fires, cars and factories, from biomass burning and from industrial processes involving incomplete combustion
    - The South Asian Brown Cloud has been shown to result in regional cooling
- Humans have also had a dramatic impact on the Earth's land surfaces over the past 5000yrs
    - The conversion of forests to agricultural land changes the moisture balance and albedo of the land surface
