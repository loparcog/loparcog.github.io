Community Music Therapy (CMT)
===

What is CMT?
- **CMT**: Challenges traditional boundaries and definitions of music therapy
    - Takes seriously how culture informs our ways of perceiving therapeutic needs
    - Seeks to develop new perspectives, role identities, and ways of doing music therapy
- Does not require referral, assessment, or treatment plan
- An approach gradually evolving in the field of music therapy
- A way of doing and thinking about music therapy where the larger cultural, institutional, and social context is taken into account
- The approach involves an *awareness* of the system music therapists are working within
    - It means that music therapy is not only directed towards the individual, but **often aimed at changing the system** that is sometimes part of the situation of the client (ie. negative stigma, lifestyle issues with current situation, etc.)
    - Even Ruud quote

Influenced by...
- **System theory** suggests an alternative to the traditional cause and effect model within science (ie. a circular model of understanding how phenomena are interacting)
- Video example
    - No leader, seems to be equality within group, opposed to a clinical dynamic where there is a clear view on who is the therapist/client and who is leading
    - More often a sense of autonomy for the participants in CMT than in other models
        - Still autonomy in other models though, just clinical goals are more clear on these, CMT is more vague
    - Not just the MT in engaging in music therapy, but also the job coaches and those working to help form autonomy for the patients

PhD Research Example
- Supervisor Dr. Laurel Trainor
- CMT - Effective for managing stress and anxiety in undergrad students?
    - Non-clinical
    - Psychological, physiological and biomarkers
    - Compared to verbal therapy
- Looking to be proactive for mental health and well being
    - Good as a society for this for physical health, but not mental
    - Also reduce stigma
- Results not to just help students in the group, but impact and make change beyond
    - How students access help, how students perceive help, make a shift from a reactive to a proactive model

Bigger Picture Goals in Addition to Specific Health Goals
- Typical CMT goals include:
    - Provider of vitality (eg. emotional stimulation and expression)
    - Tool for developing agency and empowerment
    - Resource in building social networks
    - Way of providing meaning and coherence in life (see Ruud, 1998)
- Example video (CMT with Refugees)
    - Focus on empowerment and working on strengths
    - Invite locals to CMT to reduce prejudice and increase community
    - Need to recognize how music affects each person culturally
        - MT recognized limitations and worked with other musicians to help connect more to others
    - Bigger picture goals of agency and empowerment, also for communities to bring awareness of the needs of the individuals
        - Various layers outside of the base MT work

CMT and Participatory Performance: Case Study of a Coffee House
- Elizabeth Mitchell (MTA)
- Adolescent mental health treatment facility
- Musical performance event (bi-annually)
- Youth and staff (facilitated by music therapist)
- Role of MT and multidisciplinary team
    - Provide support and help prepare before/during performance
- Purposes:
    - Support overcoming anxiety
    - Engaging in risk-taking
    - Enhance self-efficacy and confidence
    - Provide a "levelling" of institutional dynamics
        - Staff also need to participate and expose vulnerabilities, not exempt from this
- "Participatory ethos" at coffee house
    - Success = the act of participation not aesthetics
    - No judgement
    - Safe environment
    - Performing (sequential)
    - Listening and supporting
- No need to support, can still participate by helping out and supporting the safe environment
- Could be individual or in groups

Western Society and Music Making
- Expert and audience (a presentation) vs CMT (a communal experience)
- Not common for western society, used to expert and audience situation where you are either the performer hoping for good reception or the audience judging the performance
    - Coffee house unique in this sense, allow to musically express someone without worry of judgement
- Having a positive experience when making yourself vulnerable will stick with us as a very positive experience

Outcomes of Coffee House
- Increases agency outside of coffee house
- A new lens to see clients and staff
- Buzz of excitement in a setting often void of excitement/positivity
- An opportunity for creativity and normalcy
- How does the coffee house challenge the "system"?
    - Bringing excitement and creativity to mental health programs an example of this
    - Clients experiencing equality with staff
    - Feeling of "normalcy" in care center, even if not familiar to staff/client

Final Notes
- Which music therapy intervention can be implemented in CMT?
    - Music listening, improvisation, really any that work well in a group, super flexible
- Does CMT always include performances?
    - No, but it can
- Does CMT follow a clinical framework?
    - Also no
- Can CMT have clinical outcomes or benefits
    - Yes, many clinical goals can be reached through CMT
- Paradox: Music therapy is often not illness-centered, and can be experienced by a client as not a treatment - yet therefore helpful - because not viewed as treatment
