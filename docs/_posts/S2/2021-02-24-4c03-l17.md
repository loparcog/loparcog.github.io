TCP Congestion Control Mechanisms Cont.
===

Congestion Avoidance (After Slow Start)
- Slow Start figures out roughly the rate at which the network starts getting gongested
- **Congestion Avoidance** continues to react to network conditions
    - Probes for more bandwidth, increase `cwnd` if more bandwidth available
    - If congestion is detected, aggressively cut `cwnd`
    - How?

TCP Multiplicative Decrease and Additive Increase (AIMD)
- **Multiplicative Decrease**: Cut `cwnd` in half after loss event
- **Additive Increase**: Increase `cwnd` by 1 MSS every RTT in the absence of loss events: *probing*

    - Makes a sawtooth behaviour
- Why do we use AIMD?
    - Why not subtractive decrease or multiplicative increase or anything else?
    - Want to make sure network available bandwidth is being utilized
        - Can have everyone sending at a very slow rate, making sure messages send properly, but not using full possible bandwidth
    - Want to implement *fairness*
        - Can't have a "police force" to manage sending, need to rely on TCP to manage it
        - Note that fairness does not always equal efficiency
        - Ideally want max bandwidth split between all hosts
        - Will increase and decrease connections until they reach "sweet spot"
        - Sweet spot a bit more of an asymptote, not going to be able to get there, but will get really close!
        - Once rates equalize we assume fair share

Responses to Congestion (Loss)
- There are algorithms developed for TCP to respond to congestion
    - **TCP Tahoe**: Timeout only, start from slow start
    - **TCP Reno**: Tahoe + fast retransmit and fast recovery
        - Most end hosts today reach AAA (finish)

"Sawtooth Behaviour" - TCP Tahoe
- Upon timeout, cut `ss_thresh` by 1/2 and `cwnd` = 1 MSS
- Go to slow start phase

TCP Reno
- Problem with Tahoe: If a segment is lost, there is a long wait until timeout
- Reno adds a fast retransmit and fast recovery mechanism
    - Upon receiving 3 duplicate ACKs, retransmit the presumed lost segment (fast retransmit)
    - But do not enter slow-start, instead enter congestion avoidance ("fast recovery")
- Slow start only once per session (if no timeouts)
- In steady state, `cwnd` oscillates around the ideal window size
