IN THIS REVIEW:
- Network Layer
- IP and Routing Protocols
- Data Link Layer
- Ethernet/WLAN

L19: Network Layer Cont.
===

IP Packets
- An IP datagram format is given as follows:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipdg.PNG)
    - Each row is 4 bytes
- How much overhead is there with TCP *minimally*?
    - 20 bytes of TCP
    - 20 bytes of IP
    - Total of **40 bytes** plus app layer overhead
- **Protocol** (8 bits): Identifies the higher-level protocol
    - Important for demultiplexing at receiving host
    - Most common examples are 6 for TCP, 17 for UDP
- **Checksum** (16 bits): Particular form of checksum over packet header
    - If not correct, router discards packets
    - Checksum recalculated at every router
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)** (8 bits): Decremented by 1 at each hop, packet discarded if it reaches 0

IPv4 Address Exhaustion
- Fewer and fewer public IP addresses are available due to 32-bit limit of IP
- One solution is to make IP larger to get more possible IPs
- Another point is some devices don't need a public IP address, usually utilizing a private IP address
    - Network translation can translate private into public and seems to be another solution

IPv6
- Initially motivated by address exhaustion
    - Address length **four** times as big (128 bits vs 32 bits)
- Additional motivation:
    - Header format helps speed processing/forwarding
        - Would ned both source and destination to be 128 bits though
    - Header changes to facilitate QoS
    - IPv6 datagram format
        - Fixed length 40 byte header
        - No fragmentation allowed
        - No checksum
- Example image of data with IPv6:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipv6.PNG)
- Other changes from IPv4
    - Checksum: removed entirely to reduce processing time at each hop
    - Options: Allowed, but outside of header, indicated by "Next Header" field
    - ICMPv6: new version of ICMP
        - Additional message types (eg. Packet Too Big)
        - Multicast group management functions


Transition from IPv4 to IPv6
- Not all routes can be upgraded simultaneously
    - How will the network operate with mixed IPv4 and IPv6 routers?
- **Tunnelling**: IPv6 carried as payload in IPv4 daatgram among IPv4 routers

Tunnelling Example  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/tex.PNG)

IPv4 Addressing Recap
- **IPv4 Address**: Unique 32-bit number associated with a host router interface
- Represented with the **dotted-quad** notation (eg. 200.23.16.5)
- **Classful Addressing**: Divide addresses into classes  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/cadd.PNG)
    - Class A originally for big organizations
    - Class D for multicast
    - Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255
    - 127.0.0.1 is the **loopback address**
    - Problem: Class C is too small and Class B is too big!

IP Addressing: CIDR
- **CIDR: Classless InterDomain Routing**
- Idea: Flexible division between prefix and host address
- Intention: Offer a better tradeoff between size of the routing table and efficient use of the IP address space
- Ex: Suppose a network has 90 computers; what is the most efficient # of bits for prefix part and host parts?
    - SOLN:  
    Allocate 7 bits for host address (since $2^6 \lt 90 \lt 2^7$)  
    Remaining $32-7=25$ bits as network prefix
    - eg. 233.1.1.0/27

IP Addressing: Private Addressing
- **Private Addresses**: Free to use internally  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/padd.PNG)

L20: Subnets and Hierarchical Addressing
===

Subnet Ex1
- Subnet with 24 prefix part (share common network up to the first 24 bits or 3 bytes)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/snex1.PNG)
- Q: How many subnets? 
    - 3
- Q: What is the notation for the subnets?
    - **223.1.1**.0/24, **223.1.2**.0/24, and **223.1.3**.0/24
    - First 24 bits the same, and it is noted at the end as the */24*

Subnets Ex2
- Subnet with 24 prefix part  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/snex2.PNG)
- Q: How many subnets?
    - 6 (3 for the hosts and 3 for the links connecting the interfaces)
- Q: What are the notations of the subnets?
    - Links have 223.1.7.0/24, 223.1.8.0/24, and 223.1.9.0/24
    - Hosts have 223.1.1.0/24, 223.1.2.0/24, and 223.1.3.0/24

Hierarchical Addressing: Allocation
- Internet Corporation for Assigned Named and Numbers (ICANN) assigns IP address portion to...
    - Regional Internet Registries, which assigns subnet portion to...
        - Large institutions (ISPs), which assign addresses to...
            - Hosts

Hierarchical Addressing: Route Aggregation
- Hierarchical addressing allows efficient advertisement of routing information:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hara.PNG)
    - The whole collection matches the request since they all match in the first 20 bits
    - Look for common prefixes to group, specifically the shortest prefix comminality to match with the request
- In some cases, some ISPs may have more specific route  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hara2.PNG)
    - Will give the packet to the more specific matching address, so in this case, ISPs-R-Us instead of Fly-By-Night-ISP

IP Addresses: How to get One?
- Q: How does a host get an IP address?
- A: Hard-coded by system admin in a file or using **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**, which dynamically gets address from a server
    - DHCP essentially acts as a "plug-and-play", using any address it is given

DHCP Info
- DHCP message encapsulated in UDP, encapsulated in IP
- *Goal*: Allow host to *dynamically* obtain its IP address from network server when it joins network
    - Can **renew** its lease on address in use
    - Allows **reuse** of addresses (only hold address while connected/"on")
    - Support for mobile users who want to join network (more shortly)
    - NOTE: Client does not need to take given IP
- DHCP Overview
    - Host broadcasts "DHCP discover" msg [optional]
    - DHCP server responds with "DHCP offer" msg [optional]
    - Host requests an IP address with "DHCP request" msg
    - DHCP server sends address with "DHCP ack" msg
- Client-server scenario: what would be the `dest` and `src` IP addresses?  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dhcpex.PNG)
    - Communication would look as follows (`yiaddr` is your IP address):  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dhcpex2.PNG)
        - Why not just take it?

DHCP: More than IP Addresses
- DHCP can return more than just allocated IP addresses on subnet:
    - **Address of first-hop router** for client
    - **Name and IP address** of **DNS** server
    - **Network mask** (indicating network versus host portion of the address)

L21: NAT, ICMP, and Routing Protocols
===

NAT: Network Address Translation
- Motivation: A private (home) network uses just **one IP address** as far as the outside world is concerned
    - No need to be allocated range of addresses from ISP
    - Can change addresses of devices in a private network without notifying outside world
    - Can change ISP without changing addresses of devices in a private network
    - Devices inside not explicitly addressable by or visible by outside world (a security plus)
- Q: What if I have more hosts than available public IP addresses?  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/nat.PNG)
    - Map devices to one public IP and utilize ports to distinguish them
- Implementation: NAT router must...
    - Outgoing datagrams: replace `(source IP address, port #)` of every outgoing datagram to `(NAT IP address, new port #)`
        - Remote clients/servers will respond using `(NAT IP address, new port #)` as destination address
    - Remember (in NAT translation table) every `(source IP address, port #)` to `(NAP IP address, new port #)` translation pair
    - Incoming datagrams: replace `(NAT IP address, new port #)` in destination fields of every incoming datagram with corresponding `(source IP address, port #)` stored in NAT table
- Example NAT process:
    1. Host `10.0.0.1, 3345` sends datagram to `128.119.40.186, 80`
    2. NAT router changes datagram source address from `10.0.0.1, 3345` to `138.76.29.7, 5001` and updates the table to store this pair as LAN side addr and WAN side addr, respectively
    3. Reply arrives with destination addr `138.76.29.7, 5001`
    4. NAT router changes datagram destination addr from `138.76.29.7, 5001` to `10.0.0.1, 3345`
- 16-bit port-number field
    - \> 60 000 simultaneous connections with a single LAN-side address
- NAT is controversial though
    - Routers should only process up to layer 3
    - Violates the end-to-end argument
        - NAT possibility must be taken into account by app designers, eg. P2P apps
    - Address shortage should ideally be solved by IPv6

ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
- Used by hosts and routers to communicate network-level information
    - **Error reporting**: Unreachable host, network, port, protocol, etc.
    - **Status check**: Echo request/reply (used by ping)
- Network-layer "above" IP
    - ICMP msgs carried in IP datagrams, protocol 1
- ICMP message: type, code plus first 8 bytes of IP datagram causing error  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/icmp.PNG)
- Q: What ICMP messages do you use for traceroute?
- Source sends series of UDP segments to dest
    - First has TTL = 1
    - Second has TTL = 2, etc.
    - Unlikely port number
- When *n*th datagram arrives to *n*th router
    - Router discards datagram
    - Sends to source an ICMP message (type 11, code 0)
    - Message includes name of router and IP address
- When ICMP message arrives, source calculates RTT
    - Traceroute does this 3 times
- Stopping criterion
    - UDP segment eventually arrives at destination host
    - Destination returns ICMP "dest port unreachable" packet (type 3, code 3)
    - When source gets this ICMP, stop

Routing Protocols
===

Routing Protocols
- Routing protocols are implemented on the routers of a network
    - Establish paths between nodes
- Network modelled as a graph
    - Routers are graph vertices
    - Links are edges
    - Edges have associated "cost" (eg. distance, loss, latency)
- Goal: Compute a "good" path from source to destination
    - "Good" usually means shortest/least cost path

Graph Abstraction
- Graph: $G = (N, E)$
- $N$: Set of routers = $(A, B, C, D, E, F)$
- $E$: Set of links = $((A,B), (A,D), (B,D), ...)$
- Cost of path $(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_p)$:  
    $$= c(x_1, x_2) + c(x_2, x_3) + ... + c(x_{p-1}, x_p)$$
    - eg. Cost of path $(B, D, A)$

A Link-State Routing Algorithm
- Implement **Dijkstra's algorithm**
    - Net topology, link costs **known to all nodes**
        - Accomplished via "link state broadcast"
        - All nodes have same info
    - Computes least cost paths **from one node** (source) to all other nodes
        - Gives forwarding table for that node
    - **Iterative**: After *k* iterations, know least cost path to *k* destinations
- Notation:
    - $c(x,y)$: Link cost from node *x* to *y*, $\infty$ if not direct neighbors
    - $D(v)$: Current value of cost of path from source to destination *v*
    - $p(v)$: Predecessor node along path from source to *v*
    - $N'$: Set of nodes whos lease cost path definitively known
- Pseudo code:
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dijk.PNG)

Routing Protocols and Autonomous Systems
===

Dijkstra Discussion
- Algorithm complexity: *n* nodes
    - Each iteration: need to check all nodes, *w*, not in *N*
    - $n(n+1)/2$ comparisons: $O(n^2)$
    - More efficient implementations possible: $O(n\log n)$
- Oscillations possible if dynamic link costs are used
    - eg. Support link cost equals amount of carried traffic  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dijosc.PNG)

Bellman-Ford
- Defined as the following:
    - $d_x (y)$: Cost of the least-cost path from *x* to *y*
    - We get the equation:  
        $$d_x(y) = \min_{v \in N} (c(x,v) + d_v(y))$$
        - $\min$: Taken over all neighbors *v* of *x* (including *x* itself)
        - $c(x,v)$: Cost to neighbour *v*
        - $d_v(y)$: Cost from neighbour *v* to destination *y*
- Example in slides:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/bf.PNG)   

Distance Vector Routing
- **Distance Vector**: A node's least-known costs to other nodes
- Each node periodically *sends* its own distance vector estimate to neighbours **only** when its DV changes
- When *x* receives a new DV estimate from a neighbour, it updates its own DV using the Bellman equation (for each node $y \in N$):  
    $$D_x(y) \leftarrow \min ((c(x, v) + d_v(y))$$
- Each router maintains a **table**
    - Best known distance from itself and its neighbours to all routers
- Each local iteration caused by:
    - Local link cost change
    - Message from neighbour
- Notify neighbours **only** when its DV changes
    - Neighbours then notify their neighbours if necessary
- Example in slides

Routing Protocol in the Internet
- **Internet Routing Protocols**: Responsible for constructing and updating the forwarding tables at routers
- **Scale**: With up to 4 billion destinations...
    - Can't store all destination addresses in forwarding tables!
    - Forwarding table exchange would swamp links!
- **Administrative Autonomy**: Internet is equal to number of networks
    - Each network admin may want to control routing in its own network

Hierarchical Routing
- **Autonomous systems (AS)**: Region of a network under a single administrative entity
    - Holds multiple links/routers
- Internet routing works at two levels
- Each AS runs in an **intra-domain** routing protocol that establishes routes within its domain
    - AS: Region of networks under a single administrative entity
    - Link state (eg. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF))
    - Distance vector (eg. Routing Information Protocol (RIP))
- AS's participate in an **inter-domain** routing protocol that establishes routes between domains
    - Path vector (eg. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP))

Interconnected AS's
- Forwarding table is configured by **both intra- and inter-AS routing algorithm**
    - Intra-AS sets entries for **internal dests** (in the same AS)
    - Inter-AS and Intra-AS sets entries for **external dests**
- Inter-AS Tasks  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/iast.PNG)
- Ex: Setting forwarding table in router 1d
    1. Suppose AS1 learns from the inter-AS protocol that subnet *x* is reachable from AS3 (gateway 1c) but not from AS2
    2. Inter-AS protocol propagates reachability info to all internal routers
    3. Router 1d determines from intra-AS routing that its interface *I* is on the least cost path to 1c
    4. Puts in forwarding table entry `(x,I)`

L23: Autonomous Systems Cont.
===

Intra-AS Routing: IGP
- **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)**: Intra-domain routing protocol
    - Provide internal reachability

Most Common Intra-AS Routing Protocols
- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/rip.PNG)
    - Distance vector algorithm
    - Included in BSD-UNIX distribution in 1982
    - Distance metric: # of hops (max of 15 hops)
    - Advertisements
        - Distance vectors: Exchanged among neighbors every 30s vis Response Message (also called an **advertisement**)
        - Each advertisement is a list of up to 25 destination networks within an AS
    - Link Failure and Recovery: If no advertisements after 180s, neighbour/link declared dead
        - Routes via neighbour invalidated
        - New advertisements sent to neighbours
        - Neighbours in turn send out new advertisements (if tables changed)
        - Link failure info quickly propagates to entire net
    - Table Processing: RIP routing tabled managed by **application-level** process called **route-d (daemon)**
        - Advertisements sent in UDP packets, periodically repeated
- **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)**
    - "Open": Publicly available
    - Uses **link state algorithm**
        - LS dissemination
        - Topology map at each node
        - Route computation using Dijkstra's algorithm
    - OSPF advertisement carries one entry per neighbour router
    - Advertisements disseminated to entire AS (via **flooding**)
        - Carried in OSPF messages directly **over IP** (rather than TCP/UDP)
    - "Advanced" features (not in RIP)
        - **Security**: All OSPF messages authenticated (to prevent malicious intrusion)
        - **Multiple** same-cost paths allowed (only one path in RIP)
        - For each link, multiple cost metrics for different **TOS** (eg. satellite link cost set "low for best effort, high for real time)
        - Integrated uni and **multicast** support: Multicast OSPF (MOSPF) uses same topology data base as OSPF
        - **Hierarchical** OSPF in large domains

Inter-Domain Routing Protocol
- Forwarding table is configured by **both intra- and inter-AS routing algorithm**
    - Intra-AS sets entries for **internal dests**
    - Inter-AS and Intra-AS sets entries for **external dests**
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): Uses **AS path vector**
    - eBGP between gateway routers
    - iBGP between routers in the same AS
    - Policy-driven
- Example in slides:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ibgp.PNG)


Summary of Difference between Intra- and Inter-AS Routing  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/iias.PNG)

L24: Data Link Layer
===

Data Link Layer Properties
- High Diversity:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dllhd.PNG)
    - Can be used and accessed in a large number of ways
    - Going to mainly focus on Ethernet and LAN
- Fast Evolution: Grown to be 10 000x faster in 20 years


Link Layer Introduction
- Communication channel that connects adjacent nodes along communication paths are **links**
    - Can be wired/wireless
- Layer-2 packet is a **frame**, encapsulates a datagram
- Data-link layer has responsibility of transferring frames from one node to adjacent nodes over a link

Network Interface Card, Drivers
- Network Interface Card
    - Firmware: Program stored on the network card's ROM (BIOS) and configuration info stored in E2PROM
    - Hardware: ICs, connectors
- Drivers: Software interface between the network card hardware/firmware and the OS  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/nicd.PNG)

Link Layer Services
- **Flow Control**: Pacing between adjacent sending and receiving nodes
- **Error Detection**: Errors caused by signal attenuation, noise, interference
    - Receiver detects presence of errors, signals sender for retransmission or drops frame
- **Error Correction**: Receiver identifies and corrects bit error(s) without resorting to retransmission
- Which layer provides similar services?
    - Transport layer, specifically TCP
- **Half/Full Duplex**: With half duplex, nodes at both ends of the link can transmit, but *not at the same time!*
- **Framing**: Continuous bit stream at physical layer
    - Encapsulate datagram into frame, adding header and/or trailer
- **Link Access**: Channel access if shared medium

Channel/Medium Access
- Two types of "links":
    - **Point-to-Point** (dedicated pairwise communication)
        - PPP for dial-up access
        - Point-to-point link between host and switch
        - Switched ethernet
    - **Broadcast** (shared wire or medium)
        - Traditional ethernet
        - Need to detect collision
        - 802.11 wireless LAN

MAC Addresses
- 32-bit IP address:
    - Network-layer address
    - Configured, or learned dynamically
    - Used to get datagram to destination IP subnet
- **MAC Address**
    - Used to get datagram from one interface to another physically-connected interface (same network)
    - **48-bit** MAC address (eg. `1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD` in HEX)
        - Unique, hard-coded in the adapter ROM when it is built
- **Broadcast Address** (`FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF`): Sent the frame to **all** adapters
- Allocation administered by IEEE
- Manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space (to assure uniqueness)
- MAC flat address -> portability
    - Can move LAN card from one LAN to another
- IP hierarchical address NOT portable
    - Depends on IP subnet to which node is attached

ARP: Address Resolution Protocol
- Q: How to determine the MAC address of *B* knowing *B*'s IP address?
    - Each IP node (Host, Router) on LAN has an ARP Table
    - **ARP Table**: IP/MAC address mappings for some LAN nodes, given as `<IP Address; MAC Address; TTL>`
        - TTL (Time to Live): Time after which address mapping will be forgotten (typically 20min)
ARP Request Ex
- Argon has the IP address of Router 137 (eg. via DHCP)
- Argon broadcasts an ARP request to all stations on the network:  
    `"What is the MAC address of Router137?"`  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/arpex.PNG)
    - NOTE: The IP in the ARP request should match the IP of the router, image is wrong
- Router 137 responds with an ARP Reply which contains its MAC address:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/arpresp.PNG)

ARP Packet Format  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/arppac.PNG)
- Example:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/arppex.PNG)

ARP Cache
- Since sending an ARP request/reply for each IP datagram is inefficient, hosts maintain a cache (ARP Cache) of current entries
    - The entries expire after 20 minutes

"Specialized" ARP Messages
- **ARP Probe**: Check if anyone is using an IP address ("Is anyone using this address?", commonly followed by "This is the address I hope to use")
    - All-zero sender IP address
    - Sender hardware address sets to its own MAC address
    - Target MAC address set to all zeros
    - Target IP address set to the address being probed
- **ARP Announcement**: "This is the IP address I am now using"
    - Both the sender and the target IP address fields contain the IP address being announced

DHCP vs ARP
- DHCP: Acquiring an IP Address
    - Broadcast "I need an IP address"
    - Response "You can have IP address 192.0.0.0"
- ARP: DIscovering the Receiver
    - Broadcast "Who has IP address 192.0.0.0?"
    - Response: "00-E0-23-6F-A8-20 has 192.0.0.0"

MAC Spoofing and ARP Poisoning
- MAC addresses can be easily modified
    - One liner on OSX: `sudo ifconfig en0 ether 5e:c4:a4:99:b8:e3`
    - Implications: MAC address filtering in WLAN access control isn't really "secure"
- ARP Poisoning
    - No authentication in ARP
    - An attacker can use ARP announcements to poison ARP caches

L25: Ethernet and CSMA
===

IEEE 802 Protocol Suite
- A family of IEEE standards for body, personal, local area networks and metropolitan area networks
- Specifies **data link and physical layer**
    - 802.2 logical link control (LLC)
    - 802.3 Ethernet
    - 802.11 Wireless local area networks (WLAN)
    - 802.15 Wireless personal area networks (WPAN) (eg. bluetooth)
- Diagram:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ie802.PNG)

Ethernet
- "Dominant" wired LAN technology
    - Cheap (~20 dollars for 1Gbps cards, ~100 for 10Gbps cards)
    - First widely used LAN technologies
- Kept up with speed race, going from 10 Mbps - 400 Gbps

Bus vs Star Topology
- Bus topology popular through mid 90s  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/bus.PNG)
- Now star topology prevails
- Connections choices of hub or switch (switch more common now)
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/star.PNG)

Hubs vs Switches
- Both connect segments of LANs
- Hubs are *layer-1* devices that duplicate the messages to other ports
    - Computers connected by hubs are in **the same connection domain**
- Switches are *layer-2* devices that forward the messages to the selected port
    - Computers connected by switches are in **the same broadcast domain**
    - Point-to-point link between a computer and a switch
- Hub given on top, switch on the bottom  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hubsw.PNG)

Ethernet Frame Structure
- Sending adapter encapsulates IP datagram (or other network layer protocol packet) in Ethernet frame
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ef.PNG)
- **Preamble**: 7 bytes with pattern 10101010 followed by 1 bytes with pattern 10101011
    - Used to synchronize receiver and sender clock rates
- **Address**: 6 bytes, frames are received by all adapters on a LAN and dropped if address does not match
- **Type**: 2 bytes, indicates the types of the Ethernet frame (eg. Ethernet II, 802.2 LLC frame, ...)
- **CRC**: 4 bytes, checked at receiver, if error is detected, the frame is dropped
- **Data Payload**: Max 1500 bytes, minimum 46 bytes
    - If data is less than 46 bytes, pad with zeros to reach 46 bytes
    - "Jumbo frame" introduced later to lower overhead from header, holds up to 9000 bytes for 1G/10G/100G)

Unreliable, Connectionless Service
- **Connectionless**: No handshaking between sending and receiving adapter
- **Unreliable**: Receiving adapter doesn't send ACKs or NACKs to sending adapter
    - Stream of datagrams passed to network layer can have gaps
    - Gaps will be filled if app is using TCP
    - Otherwise, app will see the gaps

Medium Access Control in Ethernet
- Shared medium with bus or star topology with hubs
    - Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
    - Half-duplex: nodes take turns in transmissions
- Point-to-point in star topology with switches
    - Full duplex: Can send and receive at the same time
    - How to learn which port a device is connected?

CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)
- CSMA: Listen before transmit
    - If channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame
    - If channel sensed busy: defer transmission
- Don't interrupt others!
- Does this eliminate all collisions?
    - **No**, CSMA just **reduces** collision
- Flow chart for a packet sending
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/fc.PNG)
- Collision detection example
    - *B* and *D* can't tell that collision occurred
    - **Jamming Signal**: Inform all other stations they shouldn't transmit

Collision in CSMA/CD
- *B* and *D* can't tell that collision occurred
- **Jamming Signal**: Inform all other stations they shouldn't transmit  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/csma.PNG)

Limits on CSMA/CD Network
- Latency depends on physical length of link
    - Time to propagate a packet from one end to the other
- Suppose *A* sends a packet at time *t*
    - And *B* sees an idle line at a time just before *t+d*
    - ...so *B* happily starts transmitting a packet
- *B* detects a collision, and sends a jamming signal
    - But *A* can't see the collision until *t + 2d*
- This gives implications on minimum frame size
    - May need to pad 0's on the end of a message to make sure this is met

Switched Ethernet
- Switches are link layer devices
    - Stores and forwards ethernet frames
    - Examines frame header and selectively forwards frame based on MAC dest address
- Transparent
    - Hosts are unaware of presence of switches
- Plug-and-play, self-learning
    - *Switches do **not** need to be configured!*
    - Helps to determine which frames should be forwarded to which LAN segments (links)

Self-Learning
- A switch has a **switch table**
- Entry in switch table:
    - (MAC Address, Interface, TTL)
    - Stale entries in table dropped (TTL can be 60min)
- Switch *learns* which hosts can be reached through which interfaces
    - When frames received, switch "learns" location of sender through incoming LAN segment
    - Records sender/location pair in switch table
- If given a frame that the switch does not know the address to, send to all other ports of the switch other than the one the frame arrived from

Elements of a Wireless Network
- Wireless Hosts (eg. laptop, smartphone, tablet)
    - Run applications
    - May be stationary or mobile
        - Wireless does *not* always mean mobile
- Base Stations
    - Typically conected to wired network
    - Relay - responsible for sending packets between wired network and wireless host(s) in its "area" (eg. cell towers, 802.11 access points)
- Wireless Link
    - Typically used to connect mobile(s) to base station
    - Also used as backbone link
    - Multiple access protocol coordinates link access
    - Various data rates, transmission distances
- Two modes to run a wireless network:
    - Infrastructure mode
        - Base station connects mobiles into wired network
        - Handoff: Mobile changes base station providing connection into wired network
    - Ad-hoc mode
        - No base stations
        - Nodes can only transmit to other nodes within link coverage
        - Nodes organize themselves into a network: route among themselves

802.11 LAN Architecture  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/802.PNG)
- Wireless host communicates with base station
    - Base station = access point (AP)
- **Basic Service Set (BSS)** (aka "cell")
    - In infrastructure mode, contains wireless hosts and access point (AP): base station
    - In ad hoc mode: host only (IBSS)
- Distribution System (DS)
    - Connects multiple APs
- Extended service set (ESS)
    - Two ore more basic service sets interconnected by DS
- Some examples on speed and non-overlapping channels in slides (389)

802.11 Frame: Addressing  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/802f.PNG)
- NOTE: Each number is in bytes
- More frame data  
![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/802f2.PNG)
- Frame Types
    - Management frame
        - Beacon
        - (De)association request/respond
        - Announcement traffic indication message
        - Authentication/deauthentication
    - Control frame
        - Poll frame and poll response frame
        - RTS
        - CTS
        - ACK
        - Power save (PS-poll)
    - Data frame
        - Limitation on payload size
        - Can be extended to 7395

Association
- Host must associate with an AP
    - Scans channels, listening for beacon frames containing service set identifier and AP's MAC address
        - SSID is 32 octets long
        - One SSID per network (BSS or IBSS)
    - Selects AP to associate with; initiates association protocol
    - May perform authentication
    - Will typically then run DHCP to get IP address in AP's subnet

802.11: Association
- **Passive Scanning**
    1. Beacon frames sent from APs
    2. Association Request frame sent: H1 to selected AP
    3. Association Response frame sent from selected AP to H1
- **Active Scanning**
    1. Probe Request frame broadcast from H1
    2. Probe Response frames sent from APs
    3. Association Request frame sent: H1 to selected AP
    4. Association Response frame sent from selected AP to H1
