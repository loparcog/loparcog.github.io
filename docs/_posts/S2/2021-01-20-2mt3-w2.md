History of Music in Health and Music Therapy
===

History of Music
- Played parts in ancient civilization
    - Basic instruments found among old artifacts
- Today we have music wherever we go, but this was not always the case
    - Played many more roles than enjoyment, also for things like communications
    - Markings in cave marked best acoustic points to communicate
- **Preliterate Cultures**: Complex language, but no symbol system for written communication, therefore what we know about music during this time is *speculative*
    - Music was a supernatural force that affected mental and physical wellbeing
    - Music and medicine was almost interchangeable
    - "Medicine-men" performed healing rituals to appease Gods
    - Something not just for the elite, but encouraged for everyone to take part in, especially for religion and health
    - Those who could play music well were highly praised
- **Early Civilizations**: 5000-6000yrs BC
    - Music played an important part in rational medicine, and an important role in magic and religious healing ceremonies
    - Egyptian priest-physicians referred to music as medicine for the soul and often included chant therapies as part of medical practice
- **Ancient Greece**: 600 BC
    - Music had force over thought, emotion, and physical health
    - Healing shrines and temples had hymn specialists and music was prescribed to the mentally disturbed
    - Emotional catharsis
    - Aristotle recognized emotional catharsis, and Plato wrote about medicine for the soul
    - Very heavily used in many facets of life, dealt with through the fates and such
    - Views on what music was "good" or "bad", something still sorta done today
        - Need to avoid this in music therapy, no real prescriptive ability for everyone, it will be specific for each person and their medical goals
    - Hippocratic Oath still swears by Apollo
        - Fun fact, Apollo was also the god of music and poetry along with healing, showing music still plays a role in the medical world
- **The Middle Ages**: 476-1450 AD
    - Medicine now influenced by the 4 cardinal humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile)
    - Boethius claimed that music had the power to degrade/improve human morals
    - Saint Basil believed it to be a positive vehicle for sacred emotion
    - Hymns were considered effective against certain unspecified respiratory diseases
- **The Renaissance**: 1300-1600 AD
    - Advances in anatomy, physiology and clinical medicine marked the beginning of the scientific approach to medicine
    - Treatment of diseases still based on 4 humors
    - Physicians prescribed music as a *preventative* medicine
    - Many epidemics occurred during this time, music was considered a powerful tool to improve emotional health
        - See writings by Zarlino (musician) and Vesalius (physician)
- **The Baroque Period**: 1580-1750 AD
    - Medicine continued to be informed by the four humors
    - Kircher (use of music for disease) - matching music to personality characteristics
    - Burton (The Anatomy of Melancholy) - music for treatment of depression
    - Louis Roger, physician in 1748, wrote a book on the effects of music on the human body
- First publication most related to music therapy from 1789, unknown author, "Music Physically Considered" in Columbian magazine
    - Discusses principles currently applied in MT (ie. importance of a trained practitioner)
- **19th Century**
    - Many articles in music and medical journals for music treating physical and mental health
    - 1832 - Music programs in schools for the blind/with disabilities
    - Research and practices growing in this period
- **20th Century**
    - WW2 solders were not responding to medical care for mental well being (no term for PTSD yet), but music was used for wellness to get past this
        - Went into Soldier Project Research to research using music for health care goals
    - Resulted in first music therapy training program at Michigan State University in 1944
    - 1950 saw the creation of the **National Association of Music Therapy (NAMT)**, first association to regulate the profession of music therapy
        - Started to spread across the world, Cellist worked with people with Autism in England, working into government recognition and training programs from 1958 (BSMT created) - 1976 (British government recognized Association of Professional Music Therapy, now known as BAMT)
        - Spread across central and eastern Europe in the 1970's, and further countries done by 2005

History of Music Therapy in Canada (1970's)
- Early 1970s - Norma Sharpe (music therapist (by her own word not actually trained or anything) working in St. Thomas, ON) had regular contact with individuals and organizations across Canada who shared an interest in MT
    - Sharpe presided over first music therapy conference at St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital in St. Thomas, ON
- Mid 1970s - Conferences held to unify those working in the field of music therapy throughout Canada
    - Conferences could be used to share techniques, programs and assessment of rehabilitative effectiveness
    - Led to the formation of a national association for music therapy in Canada named **Canada Music Therapy Association in 1974**
    - First training program also started in 1974 in Capilano University, BC
- Today - Now known as Canadian Association of Music Therapists (CAMT), but also need to be recognized by the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO) today
    - First MT professional development academy in Canada launched in 2017 (founded by prof, huh)

Music Therapy Globally
- Music therapy is worldwide, moving to the World Federation of Music Therapy being developed in 1985
    - Also launched open access international journal called *Voices*

Example in Lecture
- Video of using music to play in hospitals to reduce need for painkillers to be used
    - Actually not music therapy since there is no actual music therapist involved in the project (no guidance/informing either)
    - This IS an example, however, of how music can be therapeutic and helpful, how one can think about using music meaningfully
    - Also, all controlled by musician/doctors, no input from the patients
        - A lot of assumption that they are/aren't liking it, a little fucked
        - Could invoke negative memories or feelings, something that a music therapist needs to be concious of
- This would be an example of **music medicine**, but not music therapy
- Music therapy is informed by music educators and physicians/nurses, working with music and education cognition
    - Example would be the alphabet, most likely everyone learned through song, along with many common early childhood lessons
    - Not so much later on because western culture does not like singing past ages 8-9, ashamed of bad singing or nervous on self singing
        - Example of why this is stupid is Happy Birthday, everyone goes for that regardless on "singing ability"
