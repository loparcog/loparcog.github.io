Interpolation
===

Assignment Help
- For the question dealing with $[L,U,P] = A$, where $L U = P A$
    - $U$ is an upper triangular matrix, represented by:
        $$U = M_3 P_3 M_2 P_2 M_1 P_1 A$$  
        $$ = M_3(P_3 M_2 P_3^T) (P_3 P_2 M_1 P_2^T P_3^T) (P_3 P_2 P_1) A$$
        $$ = M_3 \tilde{M_2} \tilde{M_1} P A$$
- Note that the multiplication for $P_3 M_2$ will swap the third and fourth rows of $M_2$, and is similar for any other $P$ matrix multiplication

Interpolation
- We have some data points on a graph, and we want to put some function through them
    - Say these points are a set of $[(t_i, y_i)]_{i=0}^n$
    - Find a function $v(t)$ such that $v(t_i) = y_i$
- Why not just run the function for this?
    - Maybe no function for given data, maybe expensive to run the original function for these points
    - Can also use this as a sort of "line of best fit"
- Types of polynomial interpolations:
    - Monomial
    - Lagrange
    - Newton Form (most useful)

Ex: Interpolate the following set of points:
    $$[(1,2), (2, 3), (4, 3)]$$
- First, these can be plot on a graph for a visual representation
- Then, we can get the following equations:
    $$p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2$$  
    $$p(1) = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 1$$  
    $$p(2) = c_0 + 2c_1 + 4c_2 = 3$$
    $$p(4) = c_0 + 4c_1 + 16c_2 = 3$$
- This can then be put into matrix form:
    $$\begin{bmatrix}  
    1 & 1 & 1 \\  
    1 & 2 & 4 \\  
    1 & 4 & 16 \\  
    \end{bmatrix}  
    \begin{bmatrix}  
    c_0 \\  
    c_1 \\  
    c_2 \\  
    \end{bmatrix} =  
    \begin{bmatrix}  
    1 \\  
    3 \\  
    3 \\  
    \end{bmatrix}$$
    - Solving this system gives us $c_0 = -7/3, c_1 = 4, c_2 = -2/3$
- General equation is then:
$$\begin{bmatrix}  
    1 & x_0 & x_0^2 & ... & x_0^n \\  
    1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & ... & x_1^n \\  
    ... & ... & ... & ... & ... \\  
    1 & x_i & x_i^2 & ... & x_i^n
    \end{bmatrix}  
    \begin{bmatrix}  
    c_0 \\  
    c_1 \\  
    ... \\  
    c_n
    \end{bmatrix} =  
    \begin{bmatrix}  
    y_0 \\  
    y_1 \\  
    ... \\  
    y_n \\
    \end{bmatrix}$$
- The first matrix in this equation is known as the **Vandermonde** matrix, and the determinant of this matrix is given as:
    $$\Pi_{i=0}^{n-1} [ \Pi_{j=i+1}^n (x_j - x_i)]$$
    - If $x_0, x_1, ..., x_n$ are all distinct, then $det(X) \neq 0$, meaning the matrix is nonsingular and there is a unique solution
