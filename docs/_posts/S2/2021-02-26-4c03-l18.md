TCP Final Notes & IP Layer
===

Tahoe vs Reno Example
- Initial `ss_thresh` = 8 MSS
- Assume the first two packets are lost in round 8 and there is no other loss after, what is the `ss_thresh` and `cwnd` in round 9?

- Round 9:  
    `ss_thresh` = 12/2 = 6  
    Tahoe `cwnd` = 1  
    Reno `cwnd` = 6

IP Layer

Outline
- Intro
- What's inside a router
- IP: Internet Protocol
    - Datagram format
    - IPv4 addressing
    - IPv6
    - ICMP
- Routing algorithms

Network Layer
- Transport segment from sending to receiving hosts
- On sending side, encapsulates segments into **datagrams**
- On receiving side, delivers segments to transport layer
- Network layer protocols in **every** host, router
- Router examines header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it
- Internet is structured as a "network of networks"
    - Messages pass through many networks before being delivered to their end goal

IPv4 Address
- **IPv4 Address**: Unique 32-bit number associated with a host, router interface
- Represented with the **dotted-quad** notation (eg. 200.23.16.5)
    - Break down the 32 bits into four parts, each with one byte, making it a bit more human readable  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipv4.PNG)
- **Interface**: Connection between host/router and physical link
    - Router's typically have *multiple* interfaces, while hosts typically have *one*

Subnets
- 32 bits are partitioned into prefix part and host part  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipvsub.PNG)
- Interdomain routing operates on the prefix
- Notation: `200.23.16.5/23` represents a subnet with a 23-bit prefix and $2^9$ host addresses

The Internet Network Layer

Router Architecture Overview
- Two key router functions:
    1. Run routing algorithms/protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP)
    2. Forwarding datagrams from incoming to outgoing links

Input Port Functions  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/inpp.PNG)

Forwarding Table
- Set of destination address ranges under each link interface
    - Does not have every address, and instead has a range, which each has its own outgoing link interface
    - Reduce complexity and therefore computation time
- **Longest prefix matching**: When looking for a forwarding table entry for a given destination address, use the longest address prefix that matches the destination address

Switching Fabrics
- **Transfer packet** from input buffer to appropriate output buffer
- **Switching rate**: Rate at which packets can be transferred from input to output
    - Often measured as multiple of input/output line rate
    - *N* inputs: switching rate *N* times line rate desirable
- Three types of switching fabrics:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sf.PNG)
    - **Memory**: Need to write and read data to memory, not very efficient
    - **Bus**: Transfer data through bus to output, but can only transfer one, not very efficient either
    - **Crossbar (most popular)**: Max throughput of *N* packets, direct connection

Output Ports
- **Buffering** required when datagrams arrive from fabric faster than the transmission rate
- **Scheduling Discipline** chooses among queued datagrams for transmission (not always first one!)
    - Datagrams/packets can be lost due to congestion and/or lack of buffers
    - Priority scheduling - who gets best performance, network neutrality
