Transfer Control
===

Flow Control
- In internet terms, **flow control** aims to control the rate of the sender not to overwhelm the receiver
    - How is this done?
    - Messaging the senders to let them know how much should be sent at what rate

Congestion Control
- Congestion caused from too many sources sending too much data too fast for the network to handle
    - Different from flow control!
    - Flow control concerns not to overload the receiver
- Can be manifests in
    - Lost packets (buffer overflows at routers)
    - Long delays (queueing in router buffers)

Causes/Costs of Congestion
- **Scenario 1**
    - Two senders, two receivers
    - One router w/ infinite buffer
    - Output link capacity *R*
    - No retransmission

    - This scenario would then have the following properties:
        - Maximum **per-connection** throughout of $R/2$
            - $\lambda_{out}$ is limited in the router since it is going to both Host C and D, so that is why it is limited to $R/2$, rather than $R$
        - Large delays as arrival rate, $\lambda_{in}$, approaches capacity  
            ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/s12.PNG)
- **Scenario 2**
    - One router, **finite** buffers
    - If a packet is lost at router due to a full buffer, the sender retransmits the lost packet
        - Application-layer has $\lambda_{in} = \lambda_{out}$, however, transport-layer includes retransmissions, making $\lambda_{in}' \geq $\lambda_{in}$
        - $\lambda_{in}'$ is the original data, plus any retransmitted data  
            ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/s21.PNG)
    - Realistic: When $\lambda_{in}$ approaches $R/2$, some packets are retransmitted with duplicates and are delivered

    - This would make the following costs:
        - More work (retransmits) for a given "good output"
        - Unneeded retransmissions would mean that a link would carry multiple copies of a packet
- **Scenario 3**
    - Q: What happens as $\lambda_{in}'$ and $\lambda_{in}$ increase?  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/s31.PNG)
        - Every connection here now has two routers to go through to reach their destinations, also known as **"multihop paths"**
    - The cost here would be when a packet is dropped, any "upstream" transmission capacity used for that packet will be wasted
        - As $\lambda_{in}'$ increases, $\lambda_{out}$ will also increase to a point, and then drop off

Approaches Towards Congestion Control
- Two broad approaches towards congestion control
    1. **End-end congestion control**
        - No explicit feedback from network
        - Congestion inferred from end-system observed loss and delay
        - Approach taken by TCP
    2. **Network-assisted congestion control**
        - Routers provide feedback to end systems
        - Single bit indicating congestion (SNA, DCbit, TCP/IP, ECN, ATM)
        - Explicit rate sender should send at
- Bag of tricks

UDP and TCP
- Understanding the protocol details of UDP and TCP
    - Header format
    - TCP state machine
        - Connection setup and tear-down
    - Sliding window in TCP
    - TCP flow control
    - TCP congestion control
- **UDP: User Datagram Protocol [RFC 768]**
    - "Bare bones" internet transport protocol
    - "Best effort" service, UDP segments may be:
        - Lost
        - Delivered out of order to app
    - **Connectionless**
        - No handshaking between UDP sender and receiver
        - Each UDP segment handled independently of others
    - Why is there a UDP?
        - No connection establishment (less delay)
        - Simple: no connection state at sender/receiver
        - Small segment header
        - No congestion control: UDP can blast away as fast as "desired"
    - Often used for streaming multimedia apps
        - Loss tolerant
        - Rate sensitive
    - Other UDP uses
        - DNS, SNMP
    - Reliable transfer over UDP: Add reliability at application layer
        - Application-specific error recovery
    - Header example
