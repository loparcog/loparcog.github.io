TCP Cont.

Connection Tear-Down State Diagram

- Left path is the client/server that initiated the teardown, called an **active close**
    - Each stop waits for their given ACKs
- The right path is taken by the client/server that did not initiate the teardown, called a **passive close**
- Sequences depend on messages being sent

TCP Window Control

- Helps to manage ordered sending
- This window will move once the leftmost side of the sent data is acknowledged by the receiver

TCP Reliable Data Transfer
- TCP creates reliable data transport services on top of IP's unreliable service
    - Implements **pipelined segments**, sends multiple sections without waiting on acknowledgements, sends up to the buffer of the window
- In one round trip time (RTT), a maximum of BW * RTT bits can be sent to fill up the pipe
    - Problem is we don't always know the bottleneck bandwidth, so TCP needs to have a method to estimate this, which is the job of congestion control (talked about in future)
- TCP uses **cumulative ACKs**, giving ACKs back to the sending host whenever a message is received
    - It may be lost if a new packet is sent on top of where the acknowledgement was supposed to be read, but the ACK to the new message would let the sending host know that they received both the new and old segments
    - This makes losses tolerable since they can be recognized
- Also implements **retransmission triggered by timeout**
    - After a packet is sent without acknowledgement for the packet, indicating a possibility of a lost packet, the sender can resend the packet
    - Not very efficient because no data is sent while waiting for timeout
