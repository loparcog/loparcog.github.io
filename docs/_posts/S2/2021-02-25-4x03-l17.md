Adaptive Simpson
===

Adaptive Simpson
- Automatically recursively subdivides itself to give more points at parts of the graph with large change and less points at parts with small change
- Recall Simpson is:  
    $$\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{b-a}6 \left[f(a) + 4f \left( \frac{a+b}2 \right) + f(b) \right]$$
    - We can take the approximate term to be $S(a,b)$, and then say  
    $$I = S(a,b) + E(a,b)$$  
    where *E* is the error we make
    - This error term is calculated as:  
    $$E(a,b) = \frac{-1}{90} \eft( \frac{h}2 \right)^5 f^{(4)}(\gamma), \gamma \in (a,b), h = b * a$$
- In adaptive, we would put a point *c* between *a* and *b*, giving us:  
    $$I = S(a,c) + S(c,b) + E(a,c) + E(c,b) = S_2 + E_2$$
    - Going through the derivation, the error for $E_2 \approx \frac{1}{16}E_1$, where $E_1$ is the error from *a* to *b*

Algorithm Outline
- Given *f*, [a,b], and tolerance, compute:  
$$S_1 = S(a,b)$$  
$$S_2 = S(a,c) + S(c, b)$$  
$$E_2 = (S_2 - S_1)/15  
- If $\vert E_2 \vert \leq tol$ return $S_2 + E_2$, else apply recursively on [a,c] and [c,b]
    - Recursive would look like:  
    ```
    Q1 = Simpson(f, a, c, tol/2)
    Q2 = Simpson(f, c, b, tol/2)
    return Q1 + Q2
    ```
