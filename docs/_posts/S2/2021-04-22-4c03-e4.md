- Security

L28: WLAN 802.11 Cont.
===

IEEE 802.11: Multiple Access
- Like Ethernet, uses CSMA:
    - Random access
    - Carrier sense: Don't collide with ongoing transmission
- Unlike Ethernet:
    - **No collision detection** - transmit all frames to completion
    - **With acknowledgement** - because without collision detection, you don't know if your transmission collided or not
- Why no collision detection?
    - Difficult to receive (sense collisions) when transmitting due to weak received signals (fading)
    - Can't sense all collisions in any case: hidden terminal
- Goal: avoid collisions -- **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**

Hidden Terminal Problem
- Two hosts *A* and *C* trying to talk to *B*, but they cannot see each other
    - Collision can occur since they cannot hear eachother

Medium Access Control Logic
- 802.11 Sender
    - 1: For a new frame, if sense channel idle for DIFS then transmit entire frame (no CD, DIFS is a short amount of time)
    - 2: For a retransmitted frame or if sense channel is busy then...
        - Start random backoff time
        - If sense channel idle for DIFS then timer counts down while channel idle, transmit when timer expires
    - If no ACK for transmission, increase random backoff interval, repeat 2
- 802.11 Receiver
    - If frame received OK, return ACK after SIFS (ACK needed due to hidden terminal problem)

Interframe Space (IFS)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ifs.PNG)
- Short IFS (SIFS)
    - Shortest IFS (used for ACK, CTS, poll response)
    - Used for immediate response actions
- Point coordination function IFS (PIFS)
    - Midlength IFS
    - Used by centralized controller in PCF scheme when using polls
- Distributed coordination function IFS (DIFS)
    - Longest IFS (data, RTS)
    - Used as minimum delay of async frames contending for access
- Extended Interframe space (EIFS)
    - Used when received frame containing errors
- **SIDS < PIFS < DIFS < EIFS**

More on Medium Access Control Logic
- Contention window (in slots)
    - Each station maintains a contention window (CW) set to $CW_{min}$ initially
    - Upon collision, $CW' = (CW + 1)* 2 - 1$ (*exponentially backoff*) till it reaches $CW_{max}$
    - CW is reset to $CW_{min}$ upon successful delivery

Example
- A pair of nodes *A* and *B* are sending packets to *C*
- Back-off intervals: Node *A*: 2, 3 and *B* are 2,4
- Both nodes count down at $t_0$
- Size of the backoff-window in slow before send data?
- Which node sends data?
- Size of the interframe space before *A*, *B* countdown?
- Size of the backoff-window in slow before sends data?
    - AAA (get ans)

Summary
- WLAN
    - DS, BSS, IBSS, ESS
- CSMA/CA
    - Physical and virtual carrier sensing
    - Defer transmission after a busy period
    - Exponential backoff
- IEEE 802.11 frame format

L29: Full Network Example
===

A Day in the Life
- Connecting to the Internet
    - If connected wirelessly, the laptop needs to be first associated with an AP on campus
    - For passive association...
        - Scan beacons from APs
        - Association request/response message
    - Connecting laptop needs to get its own IP address, addr of first-hop router, addr of DNS server: use DHCP
        - DHCP request *encapsulated* in UDP, encapsulated in IP, encapsulated in 802.3 Ethernet
        - AP converts 802.11 frame to 802.3 frame
        - Ethernet frame broadcast (destination: FFFFFFFFFFFF) on LAN, received at router running DHCP server
        - Switch broadcasts the frame to all LAN segments
    - DHCP server formulates DHCP ACK containing client's IP address, IP addr of first-hop router for client, name and IP address of DNS server
        - Encapsulation at DHCP server, frame forwarded (switch learning) through LAN, demultiplexing at client
        - DHCP client receives DHCP ACK reply
    - **Client now has IP address, knows name and address of DNS server and IP address of its first-hop router**
- ARP (before DNS, before HTTP)
    - Before sending HTTP request, need IP address of `www.google.com`: DNS
        - DNS query created, encapsulated in UDP/IP/Ethernet. To send frame to router, need MAC address of router interface: ARP
        - ARP query broadcast, received by router, which replies with ARP reply giving MAC address of router interface
        - Client now knows MAC address of first hop router, so can now send frame containing DNS query
        - Client now knows MAC address of first hop router, so can now send frame containing DNS data
    - IP datagram containing DNS query forwarded via LAN switch from client to first hop router
    - IP datagram forwarded from campus network into cogeco network, routed to DNS server (tables created by RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and/or BGP routing protocols)
        - Demux'ed to DNS servers
    - DNS server replies to client with IP address of `www.google.com`
- TCP connection carrying HTTP
    - To send HTTP request, client first opens TCP socket to web server
    - TCP SYN segment (step 1 in 3-way handshake) inter-domain routed to web server
    - Web server responds with TCP SYNACK (step 2 in 3-way handshake)
    - TCP connection established!
- HTTP request/reply
    - HTTP request sent into TCP socket
    - IP datagram containing HTTP request routed to `www.google.com`
    - Web server responds with HTTP reply (containing web page)
    - IP datagram containing HTTP reply routed back to client

Network Security
===

What is Network Security?
- **Confidentiality**: Only sender, intended receiver should "understand" message contents
    - Sender **encrypts** message
    - Receiver **decrypts** message
    - Others cannot understand the message
    - The identities, timing or frequency should be secrets as well
- **Authentication**: Sender, receiver want to confirm identity of each other
- **Message Integrity**: Sender, receiver want to ensure message not altered (in transit or afterwards) without detection
- **Access and Availability**: Services must be accessible and available to users

Internet Security Threats
- **Mapping**: Before attacking, "case the joint" - find out what services are implemented on network
    - Use `ping` to determine what hosts have addresses on network
    - Port-scanning: try to establish TCP connection to each port in sequence (and see what happens)
    - `nmap(url)` is an example of a mapper; "network exploration and security auditing"
    - Countermeasures:
        - Record traffic entering network
        - Look for suspicious activity (IP addresses, ports being scanned sequentially/ho)
- **Packet Sniffing**
    - Broadcast media
    - Promiscuous NIC reads all packets passing by
    - Can read all unencrypted data (eg. passwords)
    - eg. *C* sniffs *B*'s packets
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ps.PNG)
    - Countermeasures:
        - Not many, very hard to detect
- **IP Spoofing**: Can generate "raw" IP packets directly from application, putting any value into IP source address field
    - Receiver cant tell if source is spoofed
    - eg. *C* pretends to be *B*  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ips.PNG)
    - Countermeasures:
        - **Ingress Filtering**: Routers should not forward outgoing packets with invalid source addresses (eg. datagram source address not in router's network)
        - Great, but ingress filtering cannot be mandated for all networks

Denial of Service (DOS)
- Huge problem in current internet
- General form
    - Prevent legitimate users from gaining service by overloading/crashing a server

DOS: Sync Attack
- Buggy implementations allow unfinished connections to eat all memory, leading to crash
- Better implementations limit the number of unfinished connections
    - Once limit reached, new SYNs are dropped
- Countermeasures:
    - **Filter out** flooded packets (eg. SYN) before reaching host: throw out good with bad
    - **Traceback** to source of floods (most likely an innocent, compromised machine)

L31: Security and Attacks Cont.
===

Denial-of-Service Attacks: Reflection
- Cause one non-compromised host to attack another
- Eg. Host *A* sends DNS request or TCP SYN with source *V* to server *R*, and *R* sends a reply to *V*

IP Traceback
- Routers probabilistically tag packets with an identifier
- Destination can infer path to true source after receiving enough packets

Firewalls
- A **firewall** isolates organization's internal network from larger Internet (outside world), allowing some packets to pass and blocking others
    - Can also block packets from the internal network
- Why?
    - Prevent denial of service attacks: SYN flooding; attacker establishes many bogus TCP connections, no resources left for "real" connections
    - Prevent illegal modification/access of internal data: eg. attacker replaces CIA's homepage with something else
    - Allow only authorized access to inside network: Set of authenticated users/hosts
- Two types of firewalls:
    1. Packet-filtering: Stateless vs stateful, lower level implementation
    2. Application-level (also known as application-gateway)

Stateless Packet Filtering
- Internal network connected to internet via **router firewall**
- Router *filters packet-by-packet* decision to forward/drop packet based on:
    - Source/destination IP address
    - TCP/UDP source/destination port numbers
    - ICMP message type
    - TCP SYN and ACK bits

Packet Filtering Ex
- Ex1: Block incoming and outgoing datagrams with IP protocol field = 17 and with either source or dest port = 23
    - Block UCP datagrams since that is the IP protocol 17
    - Disable telnet since port 23 is used for telnet
- Ex2: Block inbound TCP segments with ACK = 0
    - Prevents any new TCP connections from external hosts
    - Internal hosts can still start connections though

Stateful Packet Filtering
- Stateless packet filtering is a heavy handed tool
    - Admits packets that "make no sense", eg. source port = 80, ACK bit set, even though no TCP connection established
- Stateful packet filtering tracks the status of every TCP connection
    - Track connection setup (SYN), teardown (FIN): determine whether incoming and outgoing packets "make sense"
    - Timeout inactive connections at firewall, no longer admit packets
- **Access Control List (ACL)** augmented to indicate need to check connection state table before admitting packet

Application Gateways
- Filters packets on application data as well as on IP/TCP/UDP fields
    - Ex: Allow selected internal users to telnet outside
    1. Require all telnet users to telnet through gateway
    2. For authorized users, gateway sets up telnet connection to destination host. Gatewat relays data between 2 connections
    3. Router filter blocks all telnet connections not originating from gateway

Limitations of Firewalls and Gateways
- **IP spoofing**: Router can't know if data "really" comes from claimed source
- If multiple applications need special treatment, each will have their own application gateway
- For application gateways, client software must know how to contact gateway
    - eg. Must set IP address of proxy in Web browser
- Filters often use all or nothing policy for UDP
- Tradeoff between degree of communication with outside world and level of security
- Many highly protected sites still suffer from attacks

Security Primers
===

Friends and Enemies: Alice, Bob, Trudy
- Well-known in network security world
- Bob and Alice (lovers) want to communicate "securely"
- Trudy (intruder) poses threat to the communication
- What can a bad person/intruder do?
    - Eavesdrop: intercept messages
    - Actively insert/modify messages into connection
    - Impersonation: Can fake (spoof) source address in packet (or any field in packet)
    - Hijacking: "Take over" ongoing connection by removing sender or receiver, inserting themselves in place
    - Denial of Service: Prevent service from being used by others (eg. by overloading resources)

The Language of Cryptography
- **Symmetric Key** crypto: sender, receiver keys *identical*
- **Public Key** crypto: encryption key *public*, decryption key *secret* (private)

Symmetric Key Cryptography
- **Substitution Cipher**: Substituting one thing for another
    - Monoalphabetic cipher: substitute one letter for another
- Q: How hard to break this simple cipher?
    - Brute force (26!)
    - Other? 

L32: Cryptography Cont.
===

Symmetric Key Crypto: DES
- **DES: Data Encryption Standard**
- US encryption standard [NIST 1993]
- 56-bit symmetric key, 64-bit plaintext input
- How secure is DES?
    - Not very, was broken in 22h 15m in January 1999
- Making DES more secure
    - Use three keys sequentially (3-DES) on each datum
    - Use cipher-block chaining

AES: Advanced Encryption Standard**
- New (Nov 2001) symmetric-key NIST standard, replacing DES
- Processes data in 128 bit blocks, with 128/192/256 bit keys
- If brute force decryption (try each key) taking 1 sec on DES, takes 149 trillion years for AES
    - Currently no known practical attack on AES when correctly implemented

Symmetric Key Cryptography
- Bob and Alice share the same (symmetric) key: $K_{A-B}$
    - eg. Key is knowing substitution pattern in mono alphabetic substitution cipher  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/skc.PNG)
- Q: How do Bob and Alice agree on a key value?
    - **Key Distribution Center**
        - Alice, Bob need shared symmetric key
        - KDC: Server shares different secret key with *each* registered user (many users)
        - Alice, Bob known own symmetric keys, $K_{A-KDC}, K_{B-KDC}$ for communicating with KDC
        - Can change per session, dynamic, known as **session key**
    - **Diffe-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol**
        - Allow Alice and Bob to agree on a shared secret in a public channel (against passive, ie. eavesdropping only adversaries)
        - Setup requires a prime *p* and a base *g*, both public 
        - System:  
            ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/dhk.PNG)

Diffie-Hellman Example
- Alice and Bob agree on $p = 23, g = 5$
- Alice chooses $a=6$ and sends $5^6 \mod 23 = 8$
- Bob chooses $b = 15$ and sends $5^{15} \mod 23 = 19$
- Alice computes $19^6 \mod 23 = 2$
- Bob computes $8^{15} \mod 23 = 2$
- Then *2* is the shared secret
    - Assumption is that finding $5^x \mod 23 = 8, 5^x \mod 23 = 19$ are hard

Public Key Cryptography
- Key difference is public encryption key known to *all*
- Private decryption key known only to receiver
- Example image (subscript indicates person being talked about, and superscripts indicates public or private)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/pkc.PNG)
    
Public Key Encryption Algorithms
- Requirements:
    1. Need $K_B^+ ()$ and $K_B^- ()$ such that (the reverse is true as well)  
        $$K_B^- (K_B^+ (m)) = m$$  
    2. Given public key $K_B^+$, it should be impossible to compute private key $K_B^-$
- **RSA**: Rivest, Shamir, Alderson Algorithm
    - Most famous public key encryption algorithm, 2002 turing award

RSA: Choosing Keys
1. Choose two large prime numbers $p,q$ (eg. 1024 bits each)
2. Compute $n = pq, z = (p-1)(q-1)$
3. Choose $e$ (with $e \lt n$) that has no common factors with z ($e, z$ are "relatively prime)
4. Choose $d$ such that $ed - 1$ is exactly divisible by $z$ ($ed \mod z = 1$)
5. Public key is $(n,e)$, private key is $(n,d)$

RSA: Encryption and Decryption
- Given $(n,e)$ and $(n,d)$ as computed above...
    1. To encrypt bit pattern, *m*, compute:  
        $$c = m^e \mod n$$
    2. To decrypt received bit pattern *c*, compute:  
        $$m = c^d \mod n$$
- Holds required property:  
    $$m = (m^e \mod d)^d \mod n)$$

RSA Example
- Bob chooses $p = 5, q = 7$, then $n=p*q = 35, z = (p-1) *(q-1) = 24$
    - $e = 5$ (so $e, z$ relative primes)
    - $d = 29$ (so $ed - 1$ exactly divisible by *z*)
- Letter examples:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/rsaex.PNG)
  
Digital Signatures
- Application of public key crypto
    - Cryptographic technique analogous to hand-written signatures
    - Sender (Bob) digitally signs document, establishing he is document owner/creator
    - **Verifiable, nonforgeable**: Recipient (Alice) can prove to someone that Bob, and no one else (including Alice), must have signed the document
- Simple digital signature for message *m*:
    - Bob signs *m* by encrypting with his private key $K_B^-$, creating "signed" message $K_B^- (m)$
    - Alice can verify this signature by checking with his public key, using the following:  
        $$K_B^+ (K_B^- (m)) = m$$
        - Can verify if her decrypted message and that decrypted message matches
    - This shows a possible verification and non-repudiation 

Message Digests
- Computationally expensive to public-key-encrypt long messages
- **Goal:** Fixed-length, easy-to-compute digital "fingerprint"
    - Apply hash function *H* to *m*, get fixed size message digest, $H(m)$
- **Hash function properties**
    - Many-to-1
    - Produces fixed-size message digest (fingerprint)
    - Given message digest *x*, computationally infeasible to find *m* such that $x = H(m)$
- Example process:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/hash.PNG)

L33: Authenticity and Authentication
===

Hash Function Algorithms
- MD5 hash function widely used (RFC 1321)
    - Computes 128-bit message digest in 4-step process
    - In 1996 a flaw was found in the design, should not be considered secure anymore
- SHA-2, SHA-3
    - 224, 256, 384, or 512 bits in digests

Certification for Public Key
- Symmetric key problem
    - How do two entities establish a shared secret key over a network?
    - SOLN: Trusted key distribution center (KDC) acting as intermediary between entities
        - DH
- Public key problem
    - When Alice obtains Bob's public key (from web site, email, diskette), how does she know it is Bob's public key and not Trudy's?
    - SOLN: Trusted certification authority (CA)

Certification Authorities
- Certification authority (CA) binds public keys to particular entities, *E*
- *E* (person, server) registers its public key with CA
    - *E* provides "proof of identity" to CA
    - CA creates certificate binding *E* to its public key
    - Certificate containing *E*'s public key digitally signed by CA - CA says "this is *E*'s public key"  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ca.PNG)
- When Alice wants Bob's public key...
    - Gets Bob's certificate (from Bob or elsewhere)
    - Apply CA's public key to Bob's certificate, get Bob's public key

What have we learned so far?
- Message **confidentiality**: shared key or public key crypto
- Message **integrity**: hash
- **Authenticity** of a digital message: digital signature
- What about authenticity of a sender/receiver?
    - ARP poisoning
    - IP/MAC address spoofing
    - Phishing attacks
- Need **authentication**

Authentication
- **Goal:** Bob wants Alice to "prove" her identity to him
- **Protocol:** Assume pre-shared secret exists between Alice and Bob
    - Alice can send a message to Bob containing her IP address and something to say "I'm Alice", along with an encrypted password containing the pre-shared secret
    - **PROBLEM:** Trudy can do a "replay attack", resending the same message and pretend to be Alice
    - **This approach does not work**, and is complex since it requires both pre-shared secret and encryption between two parties

Authentication using Symmetric Key Crypto
- **Goal:** Avoid IP spoofing, playback attack
- **Nonce:** Number *R* used only *once-in-a-lifetime*
- **ap:** To prove Alice "live", Bob sends Alice nonce, *R*. Alice must return *R*, encrypted with shared secret key  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/askc.PNG)
    - **Problem:** Does not prevent Trudy from intercepting communication, also requires shared encryption key already

Authentication using Public Key Crypto
- Can we authenticate using public key techniques?
    - Use nonce, public key cryptography  
        ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/apkc.PNG)

Security Protocols
===

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- Transport layer security to any TCP-based application using SSL services
- Used between web browsers, servers for e-commerce (https)
    - SSL can be used for non-web applications as well, eg. IMAP
- SSL: Basis of IETFTransport Layer Security (TLS)
- Most commonly used today
- Security services:
    - Server authentication
    - Data encryption
    - Data integrity
    - (Optional) client authentication
- Server authentication
    - SSL-enabled browser includes public key for trusted CA's
    - Browser requests server certificate, issued by trusted CA
    - Browser uses CA's public key to extract server's public key from certificate
    - Check your browser's security menu to see its trusted CA's
- Encrypted SSL session
    - Browser generates *symmetric session key*, encrypts it with server's public key, sends encrypted key to server
    - Using private key, server decrypts session key
    - Browser, server know session key
        - All data sent into TCP socket (by client or server) encrypted with session key
    - Client authentication can be done with client certificates
- SSL + RSA  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sslrsa.PNG)
- SSL Cipher Suite
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sslcs.PNG)

L34: IEEE 802.11 Security
===

IEEE 802.11 Security
- **War-driving**: Drive around your neighbourhood, see what WiFi networks available
    - Some use no encryption/authentication
    - Packet-sniffing and various attacks easy!
- **Securing 802.11**
    - Encryption, authentication
    - First attempt at 802.11 security: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
        - A failure
    - Current attempt: 802.11i

802.11 Security Overview  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/80211s.PNG)
- Open authentication really means no authentication, so anyone can join
- Gradually evolved for different uses (home vs large business)
- WPA2 is now the dominating protocol, currently known to be secure
    - Not easy to reverse engineer and extract session keys and such

Open System Authentication
- Establishing the IEEE 802.11 association with no authentication  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/osa.PNG)
    - Only new system here is the OSA request and response

802.11i
- Four phases of operation:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/80211i.PNG)

Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication
- Used for home/small enterprise
- Uses a passphrase to generate encryption key
    - Mainly deals with second phase of 802.11i
- $PMK = PBKDF2(PassPhrase, ssid, ssidLength, 4096, 256)$
    - Making a master key
- $PTK = PRF512(PMK, AMAC, SMAC, ANonce, SNonce)$  
    - Making a temporary key
- Image example:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/psk.PNG)

802.1x Authentication
- An IEEE standard for port-based network access control
- Provide authentication for devices connected via LAN or WLAN
- RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
- Example runthrough:
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/8021x.PNG)

EAP: Extensible Authentication Protocol
- EAP: End-end client (mobile) to authentication server protocol
    - Originally an extension of point-to-point protocol for dial-ups
- EAP sent over separate "links"
    - Mobile-to-AP (EAP over LAN)
    - AP to authentication server (RADIUS over UDP)
- Support different authentication methods: MD5, TLD, PEAP
    - Process for each of these in the slides

What is "Network-Layer Confidentiality"?
- Between two network entities: sending entity encrypts datagram payload, payload could be:
    - TCP or UDP segment, ICMP message, OSPF message, etc.
- All data sent from one entity to other would be hidden:
    - Web pages, e-mail, P2P file transfers, TCP SYN packets
- "Blanket coverage"

L35: VPNs and IPsec
===

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/vpns.PNG)

IPsec Services
- Data integrity
- Origin authentication
- Replay attack prevention
- Confidentiality

IPsec
- **Tunnelling Mode**: Edge routers and hosts are IPsec-aware  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipst.PNG)
- **Transport Mode**: IPsec datagram emitted and received by end-system; protects upper level protocols  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipstr.PNG)

IPsec Protocols
- **IKE/IKEv2**: Provides a framework for policy negotiation and key management
    - Security associations (SAs)
- **Authentication Header (AH) Protocol**: Provides source authentication and data integrity, but **not** confidentiality
- **Encapsulation Security Protocol (ESP)**: Provides source authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality
    - More widely used than AH
- AH and ESP can be used both in host and tunnel mode, but most popular is **Tunnel mode with ESP**

Security Associations (SAs)
- Before sending data, "**Security Association (SA)**" established from sending to receiving entity
    - SAs are **simplex**: for **only one direction**
- Ending, receiving entities maintain state information about SA
    - Recall: TCP endpoints also maintain state info
    - IP is connectionless; IPsec is **connection-oriented**!
- How many SAs in VPN w/ headquarters, branch office, and *n* travelling salespeople?  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sas.PNG)
- Example SA from *R1* to *R2*:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sasex.PNG)

Security Association Database (SAD)  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sad.PNG)
- Assume...
    - Endpoint holds SA state **in security association database (SAD)**, where it can locate them during processing
    - One bi-directional IPsec traffic between headquarters and the branch office
        - 2 SAs
    - One bi-directional IPsec traffic between headquarters and each salesperson
        - With *n* salespersons, $2n$ SAs in *R1*'s SAD
    - When sending IPsec datagram, *R1* accesses SAD to determine how to process datagram
    - When IPsec datagram arrives to *R2*, *R2* examines SPI in IPsec datagram, indexes SAD with SPI, and processes datagram accordingly

IPsec Datagram
- Focus for now on **tunnel mode with ESP**:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/ipd.PNG)
- *R1*: Convert original datagram to IPsec datagram
    - Appends to back of original datagram (which includes original header fields!) and "ESP trailer" field
    - Encrypts result using algorithm and key specified by SA
    - Appends to front of this encrypted quantity the ESP header, creating "enchilada"
    - Creates authentication MAC over the whole enchilada, using algorithm and key specified in SA
    - Appends MAC to back of enchilada, forming a payload
    - Creates brand new IP header, with all the classic IPv4 header fields, which it appends before payload
- Inside the enchilada
    - ESP trailer: Padding for block ciphers
    - ESP header
        - SPI, so receiving entity knows what to do
        - Sequence number, to thwart replay attacks
    - MAC in ESP auth field is created with shared secret key

IPsec Sequence Numbers
- For new SA, sender initializes sequence number to 0
- Each time a datagram is sent on SA:
    - Sender increments seq # counter
    - Places values in seq # field
- Goal:
    - Prevent attacker from sniffing and replaying a packet
    - Receipt of duplicate, authenticated IP packets may disrupt service
- Method:
    - Destination checks for duplicates
    - Doesn't keep track of all received packets, instead uses a window

Security Protocol Database (SPD)
- **Policy**: For a given datagram, sending entity needs to know if it should use IPsec
- Needs also to know which SA to use
    - May use: source and destination IP address; protocol number
- Info in SPD indicates "what" to do with arriving datagram
- Info in SAD indicates "how" to do it
