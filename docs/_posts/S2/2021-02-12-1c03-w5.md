Module 7: Atmospheric Moisture
===

Humidity
- **Humidity** is the amount of water vapour in the air
    - Warm air can hold more water vapour than cold air, resulting in varied humidity across Earth
- Latitudes closer to the equator experience higher atmospheric temperatures, so the atmosphere contains more water vapour
    - High humidity favours growth of lush, tropical vegetation
- Cold temperature of the poles results in low amounts of water vapour in the atmosphere
    - Low humidity makes for dry environments
- Humidity refers to water vapour only and not solid or liquid states of water, such as snow/ice/rain
- Humidity is expressed in a few different ways:
    - **Absolute Humidity**: The mass of water vapour per volume of air
        - Not commonly used because air volume changes frequently
        - A change in absolute humidity doesn't necessarily mean the amount of moisture in the atmosphere has changed
            - Eg. if a parcel of air contains the same amount of water vapour, increasing the size will decrease absolute humidity, while increasing the size will decrease it
        - Changes in air volume as a result of air pressure/temperature changes affect absolute humidity, even if the vapour content has not changed
    - **Specific Humidity**: Represents a given mass of water vapour in a given mass of air (expressed as mass of water vapour in grams divided by the mass of total air in kilograms)
        - Does not change as air expands and contracts, so volume changes are not important
        - Provides a more reliable estimate due to above
- **Vapour Pressure** is the amount of pressure exerted on the atmosphere by water vapour in an air parcel (measured in hecto pascals (HPA))
    - Dependent on both the density and the temperature of the air
    - High actual vapour pressure indicates a large number of water vapour molecules, whereas a low actual vapour pressure indicates a smaller number of water vapour molecules 
- Eg. Imagine a sealed container half filled with water with a lid just above the water surface
    - At first, there is no water vapour in the overlying air
    - Once the lid is removed, water molecules escape into the overlying air as water vapour through the process of evaporation
        - Energy must be available at the water surface for this process to occur
    - Amount of water vapour released into the air increases as the surface water continues to evaporate
    - At the same time, some water vapour molecules randomly collide with the water surface and bond with adjacent molecules through condensation
    - There is equilibrium between evaporation and condensation during saturation (rate which molecules evaporate balanced by rate which they condensate)
        - Upon saturation, condensation begins and water returns to the surface
- **Saturation Vapour Pressure** is the vapour pressure of the atmosphere when it is saturated
    - Maximum amount of water vapour pressure that can exist at a given temperature
    - At low temperatures, SVA increases slowly, but at higher temperatures SVA increases rapidly
        - Relationship is not linear, more of a curve
        - At 10 degrees celsius, SVA is ~12 HPA, whereas at 30 degrees celsius, SVA is ~42 HPA
- **Saturation Specific Humidity** is the specific humidity of the atmosphere when it is saturated
    - A measure similar to SVP
    - At 30 degrees celsius, the atmosphere can hold at most 26g/kg of water vapour, and this decreases to 15g/kg at 20 degrees celsius
