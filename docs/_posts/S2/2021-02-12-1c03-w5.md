Module 7: Atmospheric Moisture
===

Humidity
- **Humidity** is the amount of water vapour in the air
    - Warm air can hold more water vapour than cold air, resulting in varied humidity across Earth
- Latitudes closer to the equator experience higher atmospheric temperatures, so the atmosphere contains more water vapour
    - High humidity favours growth of lush, tropical vegetation
- Cold temperature of the poles results in low amounts of water vapour in the atmosphere
    - Low humidity makes for dry environments
- Humidity refers to water vapour only and not solid or liquid states of water, such as snow/ice/rain
- Humidity is expressed in a few different ways:
    - **Absolute Humidity**: The mass of water vapour per volume of air
        - Not commonly used because air volume changes frequently
        - A change in absolute humidity doesn't necessarily mean the amount of moisture in the atmosphere has changed
            - Eg. if a parcel of air contains the same amount of water vapour, increasing the size will decrease absolute humidity, while increasing the size will decrease it
        - Changes in air volume as a result of air pressure/temperature changes affect absolute humidity, even if the vapour content has not changed
    - **Specific Humidity**: Represents a given mass of water vapour in a given mass of air (expressed as mass of water vapour in grams divided by the mass of total air in kilograms)
        - Does not change as air expands and contracts, so volume changes are not important
        - Provides a more reliable estimate due to above
- **Vapour Pressure** is the amount of pressure exerted on the atmosphere by water vapour in an air parcel (measured in hecto pascals (HPA))
    - Dependent on both the density and the temperature of the air
    - High actual vapour pressure indicates a large number of water vapour molecules, whereas a low actual vapour pressure indicates a smaller number of water vapour molecules 
- Eg. Imagine a sealed container half filled with water with a lid just above the water surface
    - At first, there is no water vapour in the overlying air
    - Once the lid is removed, water molecules escape into the overlying air as water vapour through the process of evaporation
        - Energy must be available at the water surface for this process to occur
    - Amount of water vapour released into the air increases as the surface water continues to evaporate
    - At the same time, some water vapour molecules randomly collide with the water surface and bond with adjacent molecules through condensation
    - There is equilibrium between evaporation and condensation during saturation (rate which molecules evaporate balanced by rate which they condensate)
        - Upon saturation, condensation begins and water returns to the surface
- **Saturation Vapour Pressure** is the vapour pressure of the atmosphere when it is saturated
    - Maximum amount of water vapour pressure that can exist at a given temperature
    - At low temperatures, SVA increases slowly, but at higher temperatures SVA increases rapidly
        - Relationship is not linear, more of a curve
        - At 10 degrees celsius, SVA is ~12 HPA, whereas at 30 degrees celsius, SVA is ~42 HPA
- **Saturation Specific Humidity** is the specific humidity of the atmosphere when it is saturated
    - A measure similar to SVP
    - At 30 degrees celsius, the atmosphere can hold at most 26g/kg of water vapour, and this decreases to 15g/kg at 20 degrees celsius

Dew Point and Relative Humidity
- The **dew point temperature** is the temperature where saturation occurs in the air
    - Dependent upon amount of water vapour present
    - Provides a measure of atmospheric moisture, indicating the amount of water vapour present
    - High dew points indicate abundant atmospheric moisture, while low indicates low atmospheric moisture
- Dew point temperatures can only be **equal to or less than** the temperature of the air
    - If saturation is reached and air temperatures cool further, water vapour is removed from the air through condensation
- When air reaches saturation at temperatures below freezing, the term **frost point** is used
- Dew points also influence human comfort
    - Dew points >21 degrees Celsius are considered **oppressive**, meaning they cause discomfort
        - These values observed on hot/humid days
- The curve to report a dew point is the same as the curve for saturation specific humidity
- For a given parcel of air, the dew point temperature is the temperature at which the air parcel specific humidity is equal to the saturation specific humidity
    - These would be below the general curve of a dew point graph
    - Closer to the curve/more left is an increase in specific humidity, while vertical change is the same specific humidity, just at different temperatures
- **Relative Humidity** is the amount of water vapour in the air relative to the maximum that can exist at a particular temperature or the saturation point
    - Measure of how close the air is to saturation
    - Most commonly used measure of water vapour, it is not a measure of the actual amount of water vapour in the atmosphere
    - Can change by the addition/loss of water vapour through evaporation and condensation, or by changes in temperatures
- The equation for relative humidity is equal to specific humidity divided by saturation, multiplied by 100%  
    $$RH = \frac{\text{Saturation Specific Humidity (g/kg)}}{\text{Specific Humidity (g/kg)}} * 100%$$
- Relative humidity can also be expressed as the actual vapour pressure divided by the saturation vapour pressure multiplied by 100%
    - Changes in relative humidity can therefore be caused by changing the water vapour content of the air
    - An increase in the air's water vapour content with no change in air temperature increases the air's relative humidity, gradually approaching saturation
- Likewise, changes in relative humidity can also be caused by changing the temperature
    - Increasing air temperature with no change in water vapour content decreases the air's relative humidity, since the saturation vapour pressure increases

Module 8: Adiabatic Processes and Clouds
===

Adiabatic Processes
- At the earth's surface, a parcel of air has the same temperature and pressure as the air surrounding it
    - If we lift the parcel into the atmosphere, we know air pressure decreases with height, so the pressure around the parcel decreases, and the air parcel size increases, decreasing the internal pressure
    - This results in "slower than average molecular speeds" and a low parcel temperature
    - If lowered back to the surface, it will compress and return to its original smaller volume, increasing temperature and pressure
    - Essentially, rising expands and cools, while sinking compresses and warms
- If a parcel of air expands and cools or compresses and warms with no interchange of heat with its surroundings, it's called an **Adiabatic Process**
- As long as the air in the parcel is unsaturated or the relative humidity is less than 100%, the rate of adiabatic cooling or warming remains constant
    - This rate of heating or cooling is about **10 degrees Celsius for every 1000m of change in elevation**, and **only** applies to unsaturated air
    - For this reason, it's called the **Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR)**
        - Called a lapse rate because temperature decreases with increased elevation
- **NOTE:** DALR is **NOT** the same thing as environmental lapse rate (LR)
    - LR does not involve the movement of an air parcel
- As rising air cools, its relative humidity increases as the air temperature approaches the dew point temperature
    - If the rising air cools to its dew point temperature, the relative humidity becomes 100%
    - Lifting also results in condensation, forming clouds, and latent heat is released inside the rising air parcel
    - Because the heat added during condensation offset some of the cooling due to expansion, the air no longer cools at the DALR, but at a lesser rate called the **Moist Adiabatic Lapse Rate (MALR)**, or wet/saturated adiabatic laps rate
    - If a saturated parcel containing water droplets were to sink, it would compress and warm at the saturated adiabatic lapse rate because evaporation of the liquid droplets would offset the rate of compressional warming
    - Therefore, the rate at which rising or sinking saturated air changes temperature, or the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, is less than the DALR
    - Unlike the DALR, the saturated ALR is not constant, but varies greatly with temperature
        - Warm saturated air has a much higher water vapour content than cold air, so warm saturated air parcels forced to cool condense more liquid water than a cool saturated air parcel
        - Warm parcels also release more latent heat
    - Essentially, the saturated ALR is much less than the DALR when rising air is warm, but the two rates are nearly the same when the rising air is very cold
    - Temperature change varies, but we generally represent average cooling rate for saturated ALR as **6 degrees Celsius for every 1000m change in elevation**
- The **Lifting Condensation Level (LCL)** is the height at which saturation occurs
    - The DALR no longer operates beyond that point
    - Example in module
- The **Level of Free Convection (LFC)** is the altitude in the atmosphere where the temperature of the environment is lower than the rising air parcel
    - Because of the environmental lapse rate, the decrease in temperature for the surrounding air occurs faster than along the MALR, which the rising saturated air follows
    - This increases the upward movement
- The stability of air is determined by comparing the temperature of a rising parcel to that of its surroundings
    - If the rising air is colder than its environment, it will be more dense or heavier and tend to sink back to its original level
- The **Atmospheric Stability** is determined by comparing the temperature of a rising parcel to that of its surroundings
    - If the rising air is colder than its environment, it will be more dense/heavier, and tend to sink back to its original level. In this case, the air is **stable** because it resists upward movement and no vertical movement occurs
- An **Absolutely Stable Atmosphere** occurs when the environmental lapse rate is less than the saturated ALR
    - In a stable atmosphere, a rising air parcel is colder and denser than the air surrounding it, and if given the chance, it will return to its original position
