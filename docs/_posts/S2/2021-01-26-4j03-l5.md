Framing and Error Detection Continued
===

Ex: One parity bit is added to a *L*-bit codeword:
    $$0101001 | 1$$
    In one dimensional parity check, what is the optimal value of *L*?
- If error is detected, the frame will be transmitted
- If *L* is very large, the retransmission overhead is large, but if *L* is small, the overhead for parity bit is large


**One Dimensional Parity Check**
- What does the value of *L* imply?
    - Assume the probability of bit error is *p*, the probability of one-bit error is:
        $$P_{\text{1-bit error}} = (L+1) p (1-p)^L \approx (L+1)p$$
        $$P_{\text{k-bit error}} = \binom{L+1}{k} p^k (1-p)^{L+1-k} \approx \frac{1}{k!}p^k(L+1)^k$$
        - NOTE: The approximation here is only valid for a large *L* and small *p*, that is $p \ll 1/(L+1)$
    - When $L+1 = 10$ and $p = 0.001$:
        $$P_{\text{1-bit error}} = 0.01$$
    - When $L+1 = 100$ and $p = 0.001$:
        $$P_{\text{1-bit error}} = 0.091$$

**Frame Error Probability**
- Considering that a frame contains 10 bits, and the probability of a bit error is *p*:
    - For $p = 0.1$:
        - Probability of no error is 0.349
        - Probability of one bit error is 0.387
        - Probability of two bit error is 0.194
        - Probability of three bit error is 0.056
        - This continues until 10, in which it gets very small
    - We will use the **one bit error probability** as the probability of getting an error

**Error Detection Using One Parity Bit**
- For a small $p \approx 10^{-6}$, one bit error probability can be used to approximate the probability that the transmission error can be detected in a frame
    - Hence, the probability that a frame error can be detected (one bit error probability) is:
        $$P_e = (L+1)p$$
        where $p \ll 1/(L+1)$
- Whenever an error is detected, the frame will be retransmitted
    - What is the expected number of bits to transmit to make sure *L* bits of data are correctly received?

**Number of Bits Needed to Correctly Transmit *L* Bits**
- The equation for the frame being delivered successfully on the first try is given as:
    $$(L+1)(1-P_e) + 2(L+1)P_e(1-P_e) + ...$$
    $$= (L+1)(1-P_e) \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i * P_e^{i-1}$$
    $$ = \frac{L+1}{1-P_e}$$
- Given that $P_e \approx (L+1)p$, the expected number of bits used to successfully transmit *L* bits of data is:
    $$\frac{L+1}{1 - (L+1)p}$$
- Transmission efficiency is roughly $1 - (L+1)p$, for a large *L* and a small $p \ll 1/(L+1)$

**What is the Optimal Value of *L*?**
- The expected number of bits needed to transmit *L* data bits is:
    $$y = \frac{L+1}{1 - (L+1)p}$$
- To achieve the best efficiency, we need to minimize the value *y* (such so that $\frac{dy}{dL} = 0$)
- Deriving the above equation and setting it to 0 gives us:
    $$L^2 + 2L + (1 - \frac{1}{p}) = 0$$
- This gives us the positive root of $L$ as:
    $$L = -1 + \sqrt{\frac{1}{p}}$$

**Forward Error Correction vs Error Detection**
- Objective is to use minimal overhead to get correct data (consider only 1-bit error)  
- **Error Detection (ED)**: Retransmit data until it passes error check
- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: Add redundant bits to correct error at receiver side
    - To correct a 1-bit error, the hamming distance should be 3
    - We use *m* additional bits (parity check bits) to design a code with hamming distance 3
        - *m* additional bits can represent $2^m$ states: no-error and $2^m - 1$ single-bit errors
    - Ex: When $m=3$, it represents at most 7 single-bit errors. Hence, we can design a 7-bit code including 3 parity bits, so the 7-bit code has the hamming distance 3. There are then 4 data bits in the 7-bit code

- Given $L+1 = 100, p = 0.001$:
    - Transmission efficiency of error detection is:
        $$1 - (L+1)p = 0.9$$
    - Need $m=7$ to cover 100 single-bit errors, hence code efficiency is 0.93
- Given $L+1 = 100, p = 0.000001$:
    - Transmission efficiency of error detection is:
        $$1 - (L+1)p = 0.9999$$
    - Need $m=7$ to cover 100 single-bit errors, hence code efficiency is 0.93
