IEEE 802.11 Security
===

IEEE 802.11 Security
- **War-driving**: Drive around your neighbourhood, see what WiFi networks available
    - Some use no encryption/authentication
    - Packet-sniffing and various attacks easy!
- **Securing 802.11**
    - Encryption, authentication
    - First attempt at 802.11 security: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
        - A failure
    - Current attempt: 802.11i

802.11 Security Overview  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/80211s.PNG)
- Open authentication really means no authentication, so anyone can join
- Gradually evolved for different uses (home vs large business)
- WPA2 is now the dominating protocol, currently known to be secure
    - Not easy to reverse engineer and extract session keys and such

Open System Authentication
- Establishing the IEEE 802.11 association with no authentication

    - Only new system here is the OSA request and response

802.11i
- Four phases of operation:

Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication
- Used for home/small enterprise
- Uses a passphrase to generate encryption key
    - Mainly deals with second phase of 802.11i
- $PMK = PBKDF2(PassPhrase, ssid, ssidLength, 4096, 256)$
    - Making a master key
- $PTK = PRF512(PMK, AMAC, SMAC, ANonce, SNonce)$  
    - Making a temporary key
- Image example:

802.1x Authentication
- An IEEE standard for port-based network access control
- Provide authentication for devices connected via LAN or WLAN
- RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
- Example runthrough:

EAP: Extensible Authentication Protocol
- EAP: End-end client (mobile) to authentication server protocol
    - Originally an extension of point-to-point protocol for dial-ups
- EAP sent over separate "links"
    - Mobile-to-AP (EAP over LAN)
    - AP to authentication server (RADIUS over UDP)
- Support different authentication methods: MD5, TLD, PEAP
    - Process for each of these in the slides

What is "Network-Layer Confidentiality"?
- Between two network entities: sending entity encrypts datagram payload, payload could be:
    - TCP or UDP segment, ICMP message, OSPF message, etc.
- All data sent from one entity to other would be hidden:
    - Web pages, e-mail, P2P file transfers, TCP SYN packets
- "Blanket coverage"
