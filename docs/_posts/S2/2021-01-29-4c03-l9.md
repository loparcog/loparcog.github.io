DNS Protocol
===

DNS Records
- DNS info stored as **resource records (RRs)**
    - RR format: `(name, TTL, class, type, value)`
    - **TTL (Time To Live)**, used by authoritative DNS for indicating the validity of RR to caching DNS
- Type 1: **A (Address)**
    - `name` = hostname
    - `value` = IP address
    - eg. `pinweps02.uts.mcmaster.ca. 3600 IN A 130.113.64.30`
        - `IN` means internet protocol
- Type 2: **NS (Name Server)**
    - `name` = domain
    - `value` = name of DNS server for domain
    - eg. `uts.mcmaster.ca 86400 IN NS pindns03.mcmaster.ca.`
- Type 3: **CNAME (Canonical NAME)**
    - `name` = hostname
    - `value` = canonical name
    - eg. `www.mcmaster.ca. 3600 IN CNAME pinwps02.uts.mcmaster.ca`
        - Look at it like a "nickname" for the canonical server
- Type 4: **MX (Mail eXchanger)**
    - `name` = domain in email address
    - `value` = canonical name of mail server

DNS Protocol, Messages
- **DNS Protocol**: Query and reply messages, both with same message format
    - Application layer protocol uses **UDP Port 53**
        - Also uses TCP too, but not always implemented
    - **Message header**
        - Identification: 16 bit # for query, reply to query uses same #
    - Flags:
        - Query or reply
        - Recursion desired
        - Recursion available
        - Reply is authoritative
- Example

- Can get this through command line by using `dig +trace`

Attacking DNS
- **DDoS Attacks**: Bombard root servers with traffic 
    - 1hr on Oct 21 2002, ICMP Ping attacks on 13 Root servers
    - 24hr on Feb 6, 2007
    - 5 million queries on Nov 30/Dec 1 2015
    - Bombarding TLD servers can be potentially more dangerous
- Remedies
    - Traffic filtering
    - Distributing requests to other root servers
    - Local DNS servers cache IPs of TLD server, allowing root server bypass
- **Redirect Attacks**
    - Main-in-middle
        - Intercept queries
    - DNS poisoning
        - Send bogus relies to DNS server, which caches
    - Exploit DNS for DDoS
        - Send queries with spoofed source address, being a target IP
- Remedies
    - Use cryptographically signed response, eg. DNSSEC and DNSCurve

Socket Programming
- Goal: Learn how to build client/server applications that communicate using sockets
- **Socket**: Door between application process and end-to-end transport protocol
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4c03/sock.PNG)
- Two socket types for two transport services
    - **UDP**: Unreliable datagram, **connection-less**
    - **TCP**: Reliable, byte stream-oriented, **connection-oriented**
- Application Example:
    1. Client reads a line of characters (data) from its keyboard and sends the data to the server
    2. The server receives the data and converts characters to uppercase
    3. The server sends the modified data to the client
    4. The client receives the modified data and displays the line on its screen
- With UDP
    - UDP: No "connection" between client and server
        - No handshaking before sending data
        - Sender program explicitly attaches IP destination address and port # to **each packet**
        - Receiver program extracts sender IP address and port # from received packet
    - UDP: Transmitted data may be lost or received out of order
    - Application viewpoint: UDP provides unreliable transfer of groups of bytes ("datagrams") between client and server
    - Client/server socket interaction: UDP
