VM & Mininet Demo
===

NOTE: Final tutorial with learning

Security Lab Scenario
- Consider a security problem with the following:
    - A legitimate client for a business
    - A victim server, serving on ports Telnet, SSH, HTTP
    - Attacker between connection, using a "man-in-the-middle" system
- Each node of *Leg, Att, Vic* are required to be connected through which device; switch or hub?
- Doing this lab would be expensive for everyone getting a VM, so we're using Mininet

Mininet
- Mininet creates a **realistic virtual network**, running **real kernel, switch and application code** on a single machine
- You can define your network architecture as a Python code using the Mininet package
- Mininet is based on SDN
- The SDN controller in Mininet can configure the network switch in such a way that it acts as a hub

Software Defined Network (SDN)
- SDN entails the decoupling of the control plane from the forwarding plane, and offloads its functions to a centralized controller
- SDN-enabled nodes don't need to run control protocols among themselves and instantly rely upon the controller
    - "Controller-Defined" or "Centralized Control" may be more appropriate

Using the Image
- Linux image on Avenue which has Mininet installed, use that for assignment
- To setup you need to start
    - A terminal for Mininet
    - Three terminals for Vic, Att, and Leg nodes
    - Wireshark tool
