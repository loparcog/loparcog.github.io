Reliability and Conditional Probability
===

Lifetime
- $X$ is a random variable that represents the lifetime of a component/system
- $X$ has distribution $F(x)$ and density $f(x)$
- $f(t) \delta t$ is approximately the probability that a failure occurs in the interval $(t, t+ \delta t]$
- Would like ot know the probability that a failure occurs in a (small) time interval, given that a failure has not yet occurred
- Make this precise using conditional probability

Failure Rate
- Conditional likelihood of failure:  
$$P(X \leq t + x | X \gt t) = \frac{P(t \lt X \leq t + x)}{P(X \gt t)}$$  
$$= \frac{F(t+x) - F(t)}{1 - F(t)}$$  
    - This is just the conditional probability function
- From this, we calculate the instantaneous failure rate, $h(t)$:  
$$h(t) = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x} \frac{F(t + x) - F(t)}{1 - F(t)}$$  
$$= \frac{f(t)}{1 - F(t)}$$
    - Natural derivative action
- Also, note $h(t) \geq f(t)$
- We use $h(t)$ to represent this since it is also called the "hazard rate"
- Suppose we are given $h(t)$ rather than $F(t)$
    - With the notion $R(t) = P(X \gt t)$, we can derive:  
    $$R(t) = exp(- \int_0^t h(x) dx)$$  
    $$F(t) = 1 - R(t)$$

Rated Lifetime
- The age that 90% of components are expected to exceed
- In other worse, if *L* is the rated lifetime, then $F(L) = 0.1$, where $F(L)$ represents $P(X \leq L)$

Ex: The following data for a liquid cooling cartridge system used in Sun enterprise-class servers (10-15 yrs ago). There are thee components (blower, water pump, compressor). The lifetimes of each are independent and follow Weibull distributions, described by $\lambda$ and $a$ as:  
$$f(t) = \lambda a t^{a-1} e^{- \lambda t^a}$$
- From the density, we can derive:  
$$F(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t^a}$$  
$$h(t) = \lambda a t^{a-1}$$  
The data for each of the components is $a$ and the rated life for each component, $a=3.0$, while the rated life for the blower is 70,000hrs, for the other two 100,000hrs. Find $L_{sys}$ (lifetime of the system)
- SOLN:  
We have rated lifetimes $L_1 = 70,000, L_2 = 100,000, L_3 = 100,000$. Through intuition, we know that $L_{sys} \lt 70,000$. If the lifetimes were **exact**, then we would know $L_{sys} = 70,000$, since it is the lowest component. But since they are rated, the randomness gives it a chance for $L_2, L_3 \lt L_1$. We also know this through:  
$$P(X_{sys} \gt t) = P(X_1 \gt t) P(X_2 \gt t) P(X_3 \gt t)$$    
How can we calculate how low $L_{sys}$ is?
    1. Calculate $\lambda$ for each distribution (needed for the equation above)  
    $$F(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t^{\alpha}}$$  
    $$e^{-\lambda_1 (70000)^3} = 0.9$$  
    $$\lambda_1 = 3.072*10^{-16}$$  
    Doing the same with 2 and 3, we get:  
    $$\lambda_2 = \lambda_3 = 1.054 * 10^{-16}$$  
    Now we can turn the probability equation into:  
    $$e^{-t^3 (\lambda_1 + \lambda _2 + \lambda_3)} = 0.9$$  
    $$t \approx 58800$$

IFR and DFR
- **Increasing Failure Rate (IFR)**: $h(t)$ is a nondecreasing function of *t*
    - More likely to fail as they age
    - May become desirable to preemptively replace a component before it fails
- **Decreasing Failure Rate (DFR)**: $h(t)$ is a nonincreasing function of *t*
    - Less likely to fail as they age
    - Never preemptively replace a component
- In general, distributions may be neither IFR *or* DFR
    - So-called "bathtub curve"
    - Range over which failure rate is constant is quite often the useful life
    - First drop of failure rate is "burn-in" time, and end is "wear-out" time
- Constant Failure Rate
    - Corresponds to an exponential distribution
    - Suppose lifetime is exponentially distributed with rate $\lambda$:  
    $$h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{1 - F(t)}$$  
    $$= \lambda$$
    - With constant failure rates, CTMC approach is also available
    - Already looked at some reliability models, and it is useful for answering questions like the availability of resources

Machine Repair Problem
- *N* machines, each fail independently with rate $\lambda$
- *M* servers for repairs, each work on a single machine with repair rate $\mu$
- This is a birth-death process, proceed as with CTMC material
