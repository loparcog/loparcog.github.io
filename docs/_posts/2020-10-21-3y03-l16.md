Covariance and Correlation
===

Covariance
- Gives information on the relation of *X* and *Y*
- The relations are given as follows:
    - If your variance is greater than 0, when X goes up or down, Y also goes up or down:  
    $$\sigma_{XY} \gt 0, X++ \Rightarrow Y++, X-- \Rightatrrow Y--$$
    - If your variance is less than 0, when X goes up or down, Y will inversely go down or up:  
    $$\sigma_{XY} \gt 0, X++ \Rightarrow Y--, X-- \Rightatrrow Y++$$

Correlation
- The correlation between random variables *X* and *Y*, denoted as $\rho_{XY}$, is:  
$$\rho_{XY} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}} = \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$
- Note that $-1 \leq \rho_{XY} \leq 1$

Past Example Continued:  
$$f_{XY} = 2x + y, 0 \lt x \lt 1, -1/2 \lt y \lt 1/2$$  
$$\rho_{XY} = ?$$
- SOLN:  
We can use the following equation to compute the variance:  
$$V(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$$  
, where  
$$E[X^n]= \int x^n f_X(x) dx$$  
$$= \int_0^1 x^2 (2x) dx$$  
$$= 2 \int_0^1 x^3 dx$$  
$$= 2 \frac{x^4}{4} |_0^1$$  
$$= 2 (\frac{1^4}{4} - \frac{0^4}{4})$$  
$$= 1/2$$  
Note, we already got the regular mean from the covariance calculations, so we know that:  
$$E[X] = 2/3$$  
Now we can calculate the variance:  
$$V(X) = 1/2 - (2/3)^2 = \frac{1}{18}$$  
Next, we need to calculate the variance of Y:  
$$V(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2$$  
$$E[Y] = 1/12$$  
$$E[Y^2] = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} y^2 f_Y(y) dy$$
$$= \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} y^2 (y + 1) dy$$
$$= \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} y^3 + y^2 dy$$
$$= (y^4/4 + y^3/3)|_{-1/2}^{1/2}$$  
$$= \frac{(1/2)^4}{4} + \frac{(1/2)^3}(3) - (\frac{(-1/2)^4}{4} + \frac{(-1/2)^3}(3))$$  
$$= 1/12$$  
Now we can compute the variance:  
$$V(Y) = E[Y^2] - (E[Y])^2$$  
$$= 1/12 - (1/12)^2$$  
$$= 11/144$$  
Finally, we can now compute the correlation:  
$$\rho_{XY} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}} = \frac{\sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$  
$$= \frac{\frac{-1}{72}}{\sqrt{1/18 * 11/144}}$$  
$$\rho_{XY} \approx -0.2132$$

The steps of going through joint pdf's will are given as follows
1. $f_X, f_Y$
2. $cov(X, Y), E[XY], E[X], E[Y]$
3. $\rho_{XY}, V(X), V(Y)$
- Note that covariance is represented as $\sigma_{XY}$, whereas variance is given as $\sigma^2_{X/Y}$)

Linear Function
- Given random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$, and constant $c_0, c_1, c_2, ..., c_p$,  
$$Y = c + 0 + C_1X_1 + c_2X_2 + ... + c_pX_p$$  
is a linear function of $X_1, X_2, ..., X_p$
- The mean of a linear function AAA (finish)

Ex: Given the equations:  
$$E(X_1) = E(X_2) = ... = E[X_p] = \mu$$  
$$V(X_1) = V(X_2) = ... = v(X_p) = \sigma^2$$  
$X_1, ..., X_p$ are independent. The average of X is given as  
$$Y = \frac{X_1 + ... + X_p}{p}$$  
then,  
$$E(Y) = \frac{1}{p} E[X_1] + ... + \frac{1}{p} E[X_p]$$   
$$= \frac{1}{p} \mu + ... + \frac{1}{p} \mu$$  
$$= p * \frac{1}{p} \mu = \mu$$  
The variance of X is given as  
$$V(Y) = (\frac{1}{p})^2 V(X_1) + ... + (\frac{1}{p})^2 V(X_p)$$  
$$= (\frac{1}{p})^2 \sigma^2 + ... + (\frac{1}{p})^2 \sigma^2)$$  
$$= p * \frac{1}{p})^2 \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{p}$$
