PIP/PCP
===

Recall...
- Priority Inversion
    - A low-priority task may block a high-priority task
    - This is because even if the tasks are preemptable, resource are allocated on nonpreemptive basis
    - Die to contention and nonpreemptive allocation of 
- Non-Preemptvie Critical Section Protocol (NPCS)
    - While a task holds a resource, it executes at a priority higher than all other tasks
- Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP)
    - When a task $T_1$ is blocked due to non availability of a resource, the tas $T_2$ that holds the resource inherits the current priority of task $T_1$, executing until resource released
- NPCS vs PIP: AAA (img)
- Advantages and Disadvantages of NPCS
    - Advantages:
        - Does not need prior knowledge about resource requirements of tasks
        - Simple to implement
        - Can be used in both static and dynamic priority schedulers
        - Good protocol when most critical sections are short and most tasks conflict with one another
    - Disadvantages:
        - A task can be blocked by a lower priority task for a long time, even without a resource conflict
- PIP Advantages and Disadvantages
    - PIP avoids the disadvantages of NPCS
    - PIP has most of the advantages of NPCS
    - However, it cannot avoid deadlocks
        - Can NPCS avoid deadlocks?

Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP)
- Extend priority inheritance protocol to prevent deadlocks and to further reduce the blocking time
- Assumptions:
    1. Assinged priority of all jobs are **fixed**
    2. Resource requirements of all the tasks that will request a resource R is known
- Priority ceiling of a resource *R*
    - `ceiling(R)` = highest priority among all tasks that request *R*
    - Each resource has a fixed priority ceiling
- Priority ceiling of a system
    - At any given time, a set of resources are being used, the highest priority ceiling of this resource set is called the priority ceiling of the system
- Resource Allocation Rule in PCP
    - If *R* is held by another task, the request fails and the requesting task is blocked
    - If *R* is free, then
        1. If the requesting tasks priority is higher than the current priority ceiling of the system, *R* is allocated to it
        2. If the current priority of the requesting task is not higher than the priority ceiling of the system, the priority is denied and the task is blocked (avoid deadlock)
- Priority Inheritance Rule in PCP
    - When a task $T_1$ gets blocked by $T_2$, $T_2$ inherits the priority which is the ceiling of the allocated resource
    - $T_2$ executes at the inherited priority until it releases **ever resource** whose priority ceiling is equal or higher than the inherited priority of $T_2$, when it then returns to its original priority
- PCP Notes
    - Advanced version of PIP with **no deadlock**
    - Similar to PCP but it updats priority of tasks *upon resource contention*
