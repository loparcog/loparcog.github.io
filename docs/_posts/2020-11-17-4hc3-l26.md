UX/UI Design Process: Design Thinking
===

UI Design Process
- Better described as *UI design processes*
- Many types and forms of UI design processes
- Similar to software development with agile/waterfall/etc. methods
- Most modern UI design processes are referred to as UX design processes or UI/UX design processes
    - Especially given most UI design process done in private sector product and services
- May also be referred to as 'interactive systems design processes', or simply 'design processes/approaches'
    - Many apply whether its a digital interface or something else entirely involving users

Design processes
- Prominent design processes used in UX/UI:
    - Design thinking
        - Long history, popularized in 1990s, Stanford teaching it in 2000s
        - Five steps:
            1. **Empathize** with the user
            2. **Define** the user needs/problems
            3. **Ideate** solution(s)
            4. **Prototype** the solution(s)
            5. **Test** the solution(s)
        - Phases overlap and are not necessarily linear, iteration often used
        - Other versions also exist
    - Human-centered design
    - User-centered design
- Other design processes
    - Use-centered design
    - Usage-centered design
- Many designers and teams do not strictly adhere to one of these processes, more of an informal UX/UI design process
- For empathizing...
    - Strong emphasis on this step, understand them and their problems and needs
    - Go deeper, what values do user have, how do they think/feel/communicate?
    - Can use an empathy map, giving a visualization of our understanding of one user or multiple users, compiled from data gathered from interviews/surveys/observations/etc., can also show any gaps in knowledge
        - Other methods used as well like bodystorming (physically role-play the user's activities as the user), engage with extreme users (handle edge cases)
    - All mainly focus on "putting yourself in the user's shoes
- For defining...
    - Create a **problem statement** that captures the main problem being solved
        - Can have multiple, but commonly one to capture all deeply
    - A good problem statement is...
        - Focussed on the user and their needs
        - Leaves room for creativity
        - Provides direction to the main design goal
    - Statements made from work done during the empathy stage
    - There are also **point of view** statements, a specific type of problem statement with three parts
        1. User - who is the user
        2. Needs- needs/goals of the user
        3. Because - captures the insights uncovered during the empathy stage, "why"
        - Altogether, [user... (descriptive)] needs [need... (verb)] because [insight... (compelling)]
    - Can also assist with the problem statement by asking **how might we (HMW)** questions
        - Inspires brainstorming by asking the right questions without solutions
    - **Affinity mapping** can be used as well, saturating a space with post-it notes, and grouping them together based on relatedness
        - Another way of processing and synthesizing empathy stage data as a team to help define a problem
        - Distinct from the card sorting technique
    - **5 Whys** also used, keep asking deeper "why" questions as a response to each "why" question
        - Idea to keep digging deeper, get a better understanding of the real problem to solve
- For ideation...
    - Where we use divergent thinking to generate many potential solutions to the problem
        - Use divergent thinking techniques discussed in week 2
    - Notably we want to be *thinking outside of the box*
    - Rather than producing a large raw number of ideas, design thinking practitioners tend to emphasize creativity and challenging assumptions
    - **Double diamond model** used to first find the right problem (empathy, define), and then find the right solution (ideate, prototype/test)
- For prototypes...
    - Involves creating (a) prototype(s) of your solution
    - Can range from sketches to interactive
    - Should allow for user research to obtain feedback
- For testing...
    - Involves usability tests with users or representative users
    - Broadly defined, with prototype testing, remote testing, etc.
    - Done as a form of user research to get feedback in order to improve the design

Does Design Thinking Work?
- It's a difficult thing to test empirically
    - Even with agile software dev, it's possible to come up with metrics, but still a little tough
- How can you test design thinking though
    - Quality of designs before and after adoption? But what does that really mean?
- Many anecdotal success examples do exist though
- Also a lot of criticisms though...
    - Does not account for the importance of technical skills and knowledge
    - Ideas somewhat limited by your abilities
    - Users involved explicitly at start (empathy) and end (testing), but nowhere between
    - Takes a complex and messy process and dramatically oversimplifies it in order to make it easily understandable
    - Promotes "empathy lite", forging empathy in mere hours/days
    - Tool used to sell work, not drive real impact
