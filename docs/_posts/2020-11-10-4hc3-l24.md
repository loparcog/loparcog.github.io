Video Games
===

Video Games
- Part of the HCI
    - Remember, HCI is more than "point and click" interfaces
    - Includes areas like video games, simulations, etc.
- Video games are one of the most widespread forms of HCI
- Though video games have similarities with regular interfaces, some interesting properties set them apart
- Video games are designed with goals related to the user's performance, satisfaction, feelings, etc
- Designed according to target audiences, using design heuristics, principles and theories
- Tested w/ users, to identify usability (gameplay) issues and analyze how the game meets goals
- Differences with other HCIs
    - Regular interfaces are expected to be as unobtrusive and usable as possible
        - In video games, the interface is the game itself
    - Regular interfaces ideally error free for the users
        - In video games, the game tricks the user into making errors and face challenges as part of the game
    - Video games represent a fundamentally different design challenge than producing UIs that allow users to accomplish tasks efficiently
    - Many video games are centered on real-time computer graphic simulations, made using the rendering API of the game engine
        - Fundamentally different technologies than  documents
    - Even more than regular interfaces, video games blend aspects of the ars and humanities to produce a good UX
- UI Goals
    - We can make a distinction between traditional usability and play within video games
        - Play is where traditional usability doesn't *totally* apply
    - Traditional usability goals do apply to video games in many respects though
        - Visibility of system status (health, ammo, etc), error prevention (menu confirmations), consistency (similar buttons for similar actions across games)
- Why do people play video games?
    - The motivations to play video games are central to why traditional UI analysis doesn't always apply
    - **Play** is a range of intrinsically motivated activities, done for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious/practical purpose
- Intrinsic motivations/Psychological needs
    - Research by Scott Rigby and others shows gaming fulfills three psychological needs in particular
        - In this sense video games are about improving psychological wellness (at least in the short term)
    - **Need for competency**: Progression through a game, learning new abilities, enhance player characteristics
    - **Need for autonomy**: Autonomy in real-life is lacking for many people, high consequences for acting on the autonomy we do have
        - Games allow for consequence-free autonomy, can do whatever you want, scenarios usually out of reach to the player in real life
    - **Need for relatedness**: We want to feel like we matter, provide value in society, cooperate with others and compete to get ahead
        - MMO's are a great example of this, but even interaction with non-playable characters can provide a sense of relatedness too
- Some risks with fulfilling psychological needs throughout video games
    - People may use video games as an escape for poor competency, autonomy, and social relatedness in real life
    - Key term is **problematic gaming**, many things can be abused though, there are benefits though!
        - Many studies find gamers are generally happier and healthier than non-gamers
- Video games can be beneficial though
    - Potential for improvement of cognitive skills (spacial navigation, reasoning, memory, etc)
    - Psychological wellness (improved mood, relaxation over anxiety)
    - Social benefits (play with others, cooperation)
- Games as art/recreation
    - In this sense, video games have similar benefits to consumption of art in general
        - Watching sad movies ha been shown to be therapeutic
    - Video games act as a form of communication and spreading of cultural ideas
        - **Game studies** is the academic area that studies the intersection of games, players, and culture
        - Current research into prosocial games, encouraging helping behaviors and representation
- So how do we design *better games*?
    - Full answer beyond scope, but we can still look at this
    - Much of what we've learned is applicable to the design of video games
        - Knowing your audience (user research)
        - Design guidelines (heuristics)/principles/theories
        - Usability testing (play testing)
    - Design heuristics have been developed for video games, incorporating psychological needs
- Some game play heuristics
    - Provide clear goals, present overriding goal early as well as short-term goals throughout play
    - Game play should be balance with multiple ways to win
    - Player is taught skills early that are expected to be used later, or right before the new skill is needed
    - Players should perceive a sense of *control/impact* on the game world
