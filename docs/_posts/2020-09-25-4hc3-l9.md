Component-Based Front-End Architecture w/ React
===

Why Component-Based?
- Basic computing and software principle, break code into different modules for different concerns
    - *Sort of* given with HTML, CSS, and JS
    - Can further divide from this, but this approach only scales so far...
- More interactivity means more DOM manipulation
    - Expensive to do, not necessarily what HTML DOM was meant for, so a little hacky
    - Causes many page re-renders, 
    - **Very** complex DOM trees in modern apps
    - Making many small DOM changes not ideal...
- Some similar features being reused cannot be very easily done by a quick copy-paste, different variables, different functionality, and copying code is bad practice
    - Spaghetti coded very quickly
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** are a type of web app that only do one initial page load of HTML, CSS, and JS
    - Any subsequent data content is fetched using JS and a server through AJAX/WebSockets
    - From the user's perspective, the entire page never refreshes in response to their actions
- SPA provides a superior user experience
    - No need for multiple pages, entire page doesn't reload in response to actions
    - Imagine if phone/desktop apps did this?
    - Leads to higher subjective satisfaction for users
- Trade-off: SPAs more technically difficult to build
- Component-based frameworks are much more suited towards building SPAs
- For more on "why" we use component-based development...
    - CBD frameworks were developed in response to common problems
        - Treat DOM manipulation completely differently
        - Completely different separation of concerns
    - Component-based frameworks allow for the creation of re-usable components of functionality
        - Improve maintainability, modifiability, productivity, etc.
- Big 3 component-based frameworks:
    1. Vue
        - Easiest to learn, super elegant code, Kevin's favourite
    2. Angular
        - Widely used, but has a "split ecosystem" between older and newer versions. Relatively harder to learn
    3. React
        - Only slightly harder than Vue to learn, widely used in industry, and we get React Native as a bonus (cross-platform mobile apps)

React
- Front-end JS library for making interactive UIs
    - Open sourced by software engineer @ Facebook
- Uses a ***virtual DOM***
    - Lightweight abstraction of the DOM
- React essentially keeps a local and simplified copy of the DOM as part of its operation
- When React detects a change to app state...
    - A `diff` is run between last virtual DOM render
    - Handles any required DOM updates efficiently
- React is *rendered* onto DOM at a specific element
    - From there on, react controls the DOM at this element
- **Components** in React are created as follows:  
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    render () {return <h1>Hello world</h1>;}
};
```
- This defines a new type of component that we can render to the DOM by using `<MyComponent />`
    - Components extend `React.Component`, and at a minimum must contain a render method that returns JSX code
- JSX code is used to define how components render
    - Looks and behaves like HTML, aside from as a few behavioural differences
    - Technically a JS extension that gets ***compiled into*** JS
- Getting started w/ React
    - [Documentation Here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
    - Example code also given here
- React code demo in lecture
    - Using JSX code compiled by Babel
    - Just make a script block with `type="text/babel"`
    - Can render elements in JSX by using:  
    ```jsx
    ReactDOM.render(
        <MyComponent />,
        document.getElementByID('root')
    );
    ```
    - Note, `root` is just an empty `div`, just if you have some default HTML you want rendered
        - Also though, you need some sort of root note for rendering, meaning you can't just render a bunch of paragraphs, need to enclose in a div
        - You can only have one root node though
    - JSX elements also don't need to be components, could just be something like:  
    ```jsx
    var = <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    ```
    - CSS and JSX needs some workarounds since JS has some metavars like `class`, so we would need to use `className` in JS to refer to an object's class, and then edit that class style with a CSS
    - Can also directly call functions through JSX elements:  
    ```jsx
    function myalert(){
        alert("AAAA")
    }
    
    <button onClick={myAlert}>Click Me</button>
    ```
    - Commonly, one `App` component is made, and everything is listed under this component, to keep the `ReactDOM.Render` function clean
        - Also provides more functionality doing this through a component's render function
