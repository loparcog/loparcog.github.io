M/M/1 Queue, Exponential Distribution Continued
===

Late start, prof locked himself out of his room

M/M/1 Queue (Recall)
- Single server
- Arrivals follow a poisson process, rate $\lambda$
- Processing/service times follow $Exp(\mu)$ distributions (hence mean $1/\mu$)
- Infinite waiting room/buffer
- The M stands for markovian/memoryless, and usually is presented as M/M/1, or Arrivals/Processing Times/# of Servers
- Let $X(t)$ be the # of jobs in the system at time *t*
- The possible states (representing the number of jobs in the system) of are 0, 1, 2, ..., n
    - We claim this to be a CTMC, and to do this, we need to make a transition diagram with given rates for each transition:  
    $T_{01} = \lambda$  
    $T_{10} = \mu$  
    $T_{12} = \lambda$  
    $T_{21} = \mu$  
    This goes on for each state, since only one job can come in at a time
    - This is a description of a continuous time markov chain that captures the system behavior
- Balance equations are given as follows
    - The global balance equations are given as:  
    $$\lambda \pi_0 = \mu \pi_1$$  
    $$(\lambda + \mu) \pi_n = \lambda \pi_{n-1} + \mu \pi_{n+1}, n \geq 1$$  
- Solving GBEs can be done as follows:  
$$\pi_1 = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\pi_0$$  
$$\pi_2 = (\frac{\lambda}{\mu} + 1) \pi_1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \pi_0$$  
$$= \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\pi_1 = (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^2 \pi_0$$
- In general:  
$$\pi_n = (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n \pi_0$$
    - Still don't know what $\pi_0$, but we can use the fact that the probabilities add up to 1 to solve this:  
    $$\pi_0 ( \sum_{n=0}^{\inf} (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^n ) = 1$$  
    $$\pi_0 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{1-\rho}}$$  
    where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \lt 1$
- Finally,  
$$\pi_n = (1-\rho)\rho^n$$
- The probability the server is busy is $1-\pi_0 = \rho$. For this reason, $\rho$ is known as the *utilization* or the *load*
- Looking at different values of $\rho$ at 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 (in lecture notes), we can see things are very nonlinear in terms of $\rho$

Mean Number in System
- From infinite-state DTMC material,  
$$E[N] = \sum_{n=0}^{\inf} n \pi_n = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$$
    - Highly nonlinear - increase load from 0.1 to 0.15, mean number in system goes from 0.11 to 0.18, while increasing the load from 0.9 to 0.95, the mean number in system goes from 9 to 19
- Little's Law applies, so:  
$$E[T] = \frac{1}{\lambda} \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}$$  
$$= \frac{1/\mu}{1-\rho} = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}$$

Ex: Given an M/M/1 system, what is the minimum allowable processing rate such that an arrival rate of 2/9 jobs/minute given that the mean response time is less than 9 minutes?
- SOLN:  
$$E[T] = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda} \leq 9$$  
$$\frac{1}{\mu - 2/9} \leq 9$$
$$\mu \geq \frac{1}{3}$$
NOTE: It wouldn't necessarily be exactly the same as the arrival rate, would use this equation to match it with the response time and get an actual value with that in mind

Ex2: Arrivals occur according to a Poisson process with a rate of 9/minute. There are two servers, each with exponentially distributed processing times with mean 12s. With probability *p*, an arriving job is assigned to server 1, otherwise it is assigned to server 2. What value of *p* minimizes the expected response time?
- SOLN:  
$$p = 0.5$$  
Looking at an exponential graph, lowering the load on one server would only give a small improvement, while making the load larger on another would make a large impact, worse than the small improvement, actually making response time worse. Therefore, it would be best to keep the probability for both servers balanced, giving us $p=0.5$.  
Furthermore, we can just look into minimizing the equation for $E[T]$, although that isn't really needed for this

PASTA
- In the previous example, we implicitly used **PASTA - Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages**
    - This essentially means that *the distribution of what an arriving job sees and the steady state distribution are the same*
    - Note this is only true in this one case, not true in general
    - The proof of this is in the textbook but it's out of scope
- Ex: We have the following data:  
Time between arrivals: 0.7  
Processing times: 0.5  
$$E[N] = \frac{5}{7}$$  
$$E[N_a] = 0$$  
(Where $E[N_a]$ is the expected number of jobs seen by an arrival)
    - When you have poisson distributed arrivals though, you have $E[N] = E[N_a]$

Balance Equations Revisited
- Look back at the M/M/1 queue
    - The global balance equations (GBEs) give us that the rate in is equal to the rate out, for example:  
    $$(\lambda + \mu)\pi_2 = \lambda \pi_1 + \mu \pi_3$$  
- What if we cut the diagram at a transition between states?
    - Looking at all transitions going across the cut, from one direction to the other and vice versa, the max difference can be 1, and we also know that everything going to/from this cut needs to equal one another for example:  
    $$\lambda \pi_2 = \mu \pi_3$$
    - This gives use the **local balance equation**
- This will lead into next lecture
