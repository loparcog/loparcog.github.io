Tasks
===

Real-Time Tasks
- In real-time systems, several tasks execute **concurrently**, with each having its own **real-time constraint**
- Task Categories
    - Periodic tasks: Inter-arrival time between two instances almost same
    - Sporadic tasks: Inter-arrival time between two consecutive instances differ widely (hard timing constraints)
    - Aperiodic tasks: Sporadic tasks with soft deadlines
- A task is **preemptable** if its execution can be suspended any time to allow execution of other jobs
    - Commonly used with higher-priority tasks preempting lower-priority tasks
- Temporal Parameters
    - In order to meet real time reqs of hard real-time tasks, it is assumed that many parameters of these tasks are known at all times. Some of these parameters are:
        - Number of tasks ($n$)
            - Many embedded systems have number of tasks fixed/limited
        - Arrival/Release time ($r_{i,j}$)
        - Absolute deadline ($d_i = r_{i,j} + D_i$)
            - Moment in time at which the job must be completed
        - Relative deadline ($D_i$)
            - Interval of time when the job should be run and complete
        - Execution time ($E_i$)
            - Counts with no other tasks sharing resources
                - Depends on processor speed, complexity of instructions
            - Actual amount of time required by a job to complete its execution
        - Response time ($R_i$)
            - Time span between task activation and completion
- Periods and Phases of Periodic Tasks
    - A **period** ($p_i$) of a periodic task $T_i$ is the *minimum* length of all time intervals between the release times of consecutive tasks
    - **Phase** of a task ($\phi_i$) is also known as the release time ($r_{i, j}$) of a task $T_i$
        - First instances of several tasks may be released simultaneously, they are called in phase and have a 0 phase
- A typical task model for periodic tasks:
    - All tasks in the task set are **strictly** periodic
    - The relative deadline of a task is equal to its period (if not specified)
    - All tasks are independence, no precedence constraints
    - No task has any non-preemptible section and the cost of preemption is negligible
    - CPU processing requirements are significant, while memory and I/O reqs are negligible
- Representations
    - A periodic task $T_i$ can be represented by a 4 tuple:  
    $\Phi_i , P_i, e_i, D_i$
        - If using 3 tuple $P_i, e_i, D_i$, assume phase = 0
        - If using 2 tuple P_i, e_i$, assume phase = 0 and $D_i = P_i$
- CPU Utilization
    - A measure of the percentage of non-idle processing, denoted as $U$. Calculated by symming the contribution of utilization factors for each (periodic or aperiodic) task. The utilization factor $u_i$ for a task $T_i$ with execution time $e_i$ and period $p_i$ is given by:  
    $u_i = \frac{e_i}{p_i}$
    - And for a system with n tasks, the overall system utilization is:  
    $U = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i$
- Polling and Interrupt
    - Polling: Constantly reading a memory location, in order to receive updates of an event or input value
        - Polled loops used for fast response to single devices
        - Pros: Simple to write and debug, response time easy to determine
        - Cons: Generally not sufficient to handle complex systems or burst events, waste of CPU time, particularly when events polled occur infrequently
    - Interrupt: Upon receiving an interrupt signal, the processor interrupts whatever it's doing and serves the request
    - Brief Comparison:

- Periodic Task Implementation
    - You can use the functions `sleep()`, `nanosleep()`, and `clock_nanosleep()` to generate periodic tasks
        - All functions suspend the execution of the calling process
        - `sleep()` has a low resolution, where as the other two have high resolution of wait times
        - `clock_nanosleep()` can also change clock type, using times different than regular clock times
