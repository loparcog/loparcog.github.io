Gamification
===

Gamification
- Use of game design elements in non-game contexts
    - eg. Providing badges to users that learn how to use specific features of your application
- Using a game for purposes besides entertainment is strictly speaking **not** gamification
    - Would be called a **serious game**, like an educational game
- Gamification can be used to improve:
    - Motivation
    - Engagement
    - Productivity
    - Learning
    - Knowledge retention
    - Usability (subjective satisfaction)
- Many of these are attitudes, habits, and feelings more associated with UX goals than UI goals
- Key value of gamification is ability to modify behavior
- Can go beyond software applications (reward points for credit cards, leaderboards for classroom participation)
    - Became popular in 2010 era, lots of successful examples
- Need to be aware of the possible game design elements we could integrate
    - Need to also understand how game design elements can influence user behavior, particularly in a longer-lasting way
    - Can't treat it like "magic" though, need to leverage research into their effectiveness, can combine elements, etc.
    - Exactly how *many* elements can be included before gamification turns into a game is subjective
- Badges
    - Visual representations of achievemenets by the player
        - A form of feedback and reward that provides motivation for the player
        - If visible to others, they can provide motivations for other players as well
    - Make up part of a layered reward system, improved badges for higher achievements
        - Green checkmark for getting something right, but gold checkmark for 5/5 right
- Points
    - Numerical representation of the user's progress
        - Might call points a score
        - Might visually represent with **performance graphs** like meters, progress bars, etc.
    - Feedback that allow users to measure their progress, providing motivation through recognition
    - Rewards or badges may be offered for level of points achieved
- Leaderboards
    - Rank individuals relative to one another according to some criteria
        - Motivates users performance through competition
        - Social pressure increases engagement
        - Might provide badges for leaders
    - Can actually be demotivational for individuals very far behind
    - Work most effectively when participants are similar in ability or skill level
- Time Limits
    - Particular point in time in which something must be accomplished
    - Motivate user to focus on the task at hand, forces user to "be in the moment"
    - Can be demotivational though for users that perform slower, will experience frustration at failure to make an accomplishment
        - Not knowing how to use interface or tools vs not knowing how to actually do the task
- Teams
    - Groups of users in competition against other groups, or otherwise competing together
    - Can foster motivation through competition, but also through co-operation
        - Cooperation is a prosocial behavior, promoting other prosocial behaviors such as sharing and helping
        - Individuals incentivized to help others on a team perform better
    - Competition may not be ideal in some cases, shy or introverted individuals may prefer solitary participation
- Avatars
    - Visual representations of the user, can commonly be created and customized
    - Allow users to create an identity within the application
        - Give control over identity
    - Allow users to participate in a community
- Meaningful Stories
    - Narratives that are meaningful to the user
    - Meaningful stories can provide powerful motivation beyond badges or points
        - Also provides sense of progress to the user
    - Stories do not need to have linear narratives, choice might be accommodated in this way
        - ie. Multiple alternative endings and "side quests" may be accomodated in this way
- Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)
    - A method of automatically modifying a game's features, behaviors, and scenarios in real-time, depending on the players skill
        - Prevent players from being bored from a game that's too easy, or frustrated from a game that's too hard
    - Can use dynamic difficulty adjustments as part of gamification
        - ie. Increasing time limits for players that are struggling
- Designing applications with gamification must be done carefully and thoughtfully
    - As discussed, some forms can have adverse effects on motivation, engagement, etc
    - How can we be more successful using gamification
- Answer is **design for your audience**
    - Choose appropriate game design elements
    - Make gamification meaningful for the audience
    - Motivate based on psychological needs (control, feedback)

- Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivation
    - Extrinsic motivation is when you engage in behavior for external rewards (grades, money, etc.)
    - Intrinsic motivation is when you engage in behavior because you find it rewarding for its own sake (reading a book you find interesting)
    - Studies show offering too many external awards can *decrease* intrinsic motivation
        - Can also encourage intrinsic motivation though
- Meaningful Gamification
    - Aims to help users find meaningful connections with the underlying nongame activities, and using rewards only when truly necessary
    - In contrast to "rewards-based gamification"
        - Idea is when the rewards stop, so does the behavior
        - Meaningful gamification aims for lasting behavior changes
    - How to do this?
        - Allow for choice, free form play
        - Make rewards, narrative and goals relevant to intrinsic player goals and interests
        - Let users decide their own goals and rewards
