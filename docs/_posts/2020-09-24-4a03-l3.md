Technology Assessment
- Assess technologies so make sure it is satisfying stakeholders and environmental/ethical constraints
- Assessment teams to include a mix of
    - Social scientists
    - Legal experts
    - Engineers/scientists
    - Non-professional/ordinary citizens
- Four basic questions:
    1. How will the technology be used?
    2. What will the technology be used for?
    3. Who will the technology's users be?
    4. Who will decide how the technology will be used?
- More constructively...
    - What familiar technologies do we **WANT** this technology to be like?
    - What boundaries do we **WANT** this technology to cross and not cross?
        - These questions based on the premise that as a society we can shape how technology is developed
- Uses/Outcomes of a TA
    - Identify control needs
    - Encourage development of a technology into new areas
    - Identify needed institutional changes
    - Provide sound inputs to all interested parties
    - Identify new benefits
    - Identify intervention experiments
    - Delay project
    - Identify partial or incremental implementation
    - Prevent technology from deploying

Choosing a Central Question
- What is inquiry?
    - A one sentence central question that the investigator really wants to answer
    - It is not prescriptive, presenting descriptive info on a topic
        - Also not offering a solution to a design problem as in a design project
    - Pick something that interests you, always start with the "why"
- The CQ provides a framework within which to organize the investigation
    - If it does not leap out at you, start writing down as many questions as you can in your domain
- Types of CQs
    - Understanding a presumed relationship
        - Human activity and global warming
    - Understanding a controversy
        - Genome editing
    - Understanding a theory/concept
        - Do virtue ethics hold up in 2020
    - Understanding a process
        - Compensating victims of faulty devices
- Some pitfalls
    - The scope of the CQ may be too large, don't be afraid to constrain it geographically, or by demographic
    - Watch out for biases in your CQ and research
    - Don't be sidetracked away from your CQ
    - Be aware of the strength of your references
- Anticipate findings
    - Once you have your CQ, don't research right away, formulate what you expect to find
    - Take 15 minutes at most to come up with what you think the answers are
        - You should be able to come up with a minimum of three
        - If not, your question may not be large enough
- Research
    - Anticipated findings serve as a guide
    - Lookout for factors that were not anticipated
    - Make sure all sides of an issue are explored
        - If you can get ~4 pages double spaced of info, you should be fine
- Conclusion
    - Your inquiry may not be conclusive
    - If it is, indicate whether your evidence/arguments are weak/strong
    - The concluding section can include recommendations but it doesn't have to
