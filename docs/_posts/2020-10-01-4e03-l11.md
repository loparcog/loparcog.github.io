Exponential Distribution & Poisson Process
===
Exponential Distribution
- Property 1
    - As a reminder, the memoryless property is defined as:  

    $$P(X \gt s + t \| X \gt s) = P(X \gt t)$$  

    With this in mind, we have the first property. Given $X_1~Exp(\lambda_1), X_2~Exp(\lambda_2)$, and $X_1, X_2$ are independent, then:  

    $$P(X_1 \lt X_2) = \int_0^{\inf} P(X_1 \lt X_2 \| X_2 = x) fx_2(x) dx$$  

    This can be broken down further to:  

    $$1 - \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}$$

    - Compare this to $X_1 ~U[1,2]$ and $X_2~U[3,4]$
        - $P(X_1 \lt X_2) = 1$, since the value range of $X_2$ is always over $X_1$
- Property 2
    - Given $X_1~Exp(\lambda_1), X_2~Exp(\lambda_2)$, and $X_1, X_2$ are independent, then:  

    $$X = \min(X_1,X_2) ~ Exp(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)$$

- Ex: The download time for File 1 is $X_1~Exp(1)$. The download time for File 2 is $X_2~Exp(\frac{1}{2})$. The downloads are started simultaneously and the download times are independent.
    - a) What is the expected time to download one file?  
    SOLN:  
    Note, the regular averages of each are given as:  
    $$E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}, E[X_1] = 1, E[X_2] = 2$$  
    Now, to solve this problem:  
    $$X = \min(X_1, X_2) ~ Exp(1 + \frac{1}{2})$$  
    $$= E[X] = \frac{2}{3}$$
    - b) What is the probability that File 1 is downloaded first?  
    SOLN:  
    $$P(X_1 \lt X_2) = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2} = \frac{2}{3}$$
    - c) What is the expected time to download both files?  
    SOLN:  
    $$Y = \max(X_1, X_2)$$  
    $$E[Y] = E[X] + E[X_1] P(X_1 \lt X_2) + E[X_2] P(X_2 \lt X_1)$$  

Counting Process
- Let $N(t)$ be a counting process:
    1. $N(t)$ is nondecreasing
    2. $N(t) = 0, 1, 2, ...$
- The process $N(t)$ counts *events*, ie. arrivals
- Independent increments
    - A process has independent increments if for non-overlapping time intervals $(t_0, t_1), (t_2, t_3), ... , (t_{2n}, t_{2n+1})$, we have:  
    
    $$P(N(t_1) - N(t_0) = k_0, N(t_3) - N(t_2) = k_1, ..., N(t{2n+1}) - N(t_{2n}) = k_n)$$  
    $$= P(N(t_1) - N(t_0) = k_0) P(N(t_3) - N(t_2) = k_1) ...$$  
    $$P(N(t_{2n+1}) - N(t_{2n}) = k_n)$$
- Stationary Increments
    - A process has stationary increments if $\forall s \geq 0$:  

    $$P(N(t + s) - N(s) = k) = P(N(t) = k)$$

- **Poisson Process**
    - Definition 1: A poisson process with rate $\lambda$ is a counting process such that:
    1. $N(0) = 0$
    2. The process has independent increments
    3. The number of events in any interval of length *t* is Poisson distributed with mean $\lambda t$. That is, $\forall s, t \geq 0$  

    $$P(N(t+s) - N(s) = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda t}(\lambda t)^k}{k!}, k=0, 1, ...$$

    - Definition 2: A poisson process with rate $\lambda$ is a counting process such that the interarrival times are *independent and identically distributed* (IID) exponential random variables with rate $\lambda$ and $N(0) = 0$

- Paid site I am in no way happy about using
- Basically make a submission, anonymously submit feedback, and then give feedback on that feedback
- Going to be due "later on", don't worry about it too much right now but add it to the deadline list
