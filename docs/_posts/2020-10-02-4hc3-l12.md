React Continued 2
===

Single Page Applications
- Load a single HTML page, dynamically updating the page as the user interacts with the application
- New problem with SPAs is that the user expects new URLs, how do we keep the URL in sync with the content?
    - URL in browser bar must match on what the user is viewing/where they click
    - Helps for back/forward buttons to act as expected
    - User should be able to enter URL to navigate to a certain page
- This can be done with **React/Router**
    - Created to help developers make single-page apps with ReactJS
    - Works to keep URL in sync with UI
    - Works similarly to react components
- Helpful to use with node/npm
- Works by their own link components, which create links to paths that React Router will recognize
    - Some code examples within the slides
- Can also make custom URLs, for things like page ID, etc
