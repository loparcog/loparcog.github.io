Kernel Modules
===

**Review**
- Going over the intro quiz, specifically the code snippet
    - The code `#define N 3+5` sets N to actually 3+5, not 7
    - Acts as a pre-processor variable, nothing in a define call is actually run
    - Also, the swap doesn't work because the vars are passed by value, not by reference
        - To pass by reference in C, you'd need to pass the vars as a pointer
- **Preemption** is the act of temporarily interrupting a currently scheduled task in favour of a higher priority task
- Why are tasks not preemptible in a RTOS?
    - If not, a long running process may starve the real-time tasks
- If you need to implement a real-time task, should you use a kernel program or other program? Why?
    - A user program cannot preempt a kernel task, so if the kernel task accesses resources for a long time, the real-time tasks will be delayed. Therefore, real-time tasks should be used as a kernel program

**Kernel Modules**
- Two approaches to implement RTOS based on Linux
    1. Add a new layer of RT Kernel with full control of interrupts and processor key features
        - RTAI and RTLinux both use real-time kernel as the main kernel
    2. Make necessary changes in Linux Kernel to make it suitable for real time applications (preempt RT)
        - Implements RT tasks are kernel modules
    - NOTE: Preempt RT in labs is provided by National Instruments as part of NI myRIO, so the kernel threads are preemptable
    - A **kernel module** is a piece of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel w/o the need to reboot the system
    - We don't need to include all the possible anticipated functionality into the base kernel
        - Stops wasting memory and users don't need to rebuild and reboot the base kernel every time they require new functionality
- Related commands include:
    - `insmod` (insert a module)
    - `rmmod` (remove a module) 
    - `lsmod` (show currently loaded modules)
    - `modinfo` (show information about a given Linux Kernel module)

**Development Fundamentals**
- A real-time task running as a kernel module consists of three sections
    1. Function `init_module()`: Invoked by `insmod` to prepare for later invocation of module's functions
        - Can be used to allocate required system resources, declare and start tasks, etc.
    2. Task specific code (based on POSIX API)
    3. Function `cleanup_module()`: Invoked by `rmmod` to inform kernel that the module's functions will not be called anymore.
        - Good place to release all system resources allocated during the lifetime of this module, stop and delete tasks, etc.
- A simple example:

- Compiling kernel modules, done using makefiles
    - Objectives in makefile include `all` and `clean`, along with any others you decide to define
    - By default, the first target will be executed if just `make` is run on the file
    - Example:  
    ![img]({{ site.url }}/assets/4aa4/make.png)
- `module_init()` and `init_module()`
    - Any name can be used with these, but you need to mark those functions with `__init` and `__exit`, and they should also be marked as `static`
    - Can also do the same with variables, but instead of a marker end the variable name with `__initdata`
- There are other macros that can also be used like `DRIVER_AUTHOR`, `DRIVE DESK`, etc.
- **Passing command line arguments**
    - Command line args can be passed to modules but NOT with `argv` and `argc`
    - First, declare variables that will be used to store values passed on the command line
    - Then, set them up using the macro `module_param(name, type, permissions)`
    - At run time, `insmod` will fill up the variables with values passed

- Quick Review
    1. A good scheduling algorithm for hard real-time tasks must try to complete each task in the shortest time possible (F)
    2. Soft real-time systems are those which do not have any time constraint associated with them (F)
