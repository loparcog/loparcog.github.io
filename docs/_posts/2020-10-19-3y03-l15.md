Joint Probability Density Function (pdf)
===

Notes
- There are youtube videos on "Dr Vivian" with some extra content (found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrzRcInhaT080LBvnQUXvlw))
    - Also recordings, but can also be found on the echo360 site
- Assignment 4 is NOT for marks, practice set
    - Databank data set to practice some work on
    - Using R to process data
    - Also some videos available on R tutorials
- Also went through some review to refresh on Ch.5 info

Joint Pdf of Continuous Random Variables (CRV)
- A pdf for multiple variables, given as:  
$$f_{X,Y}(x, y)$$
- Note, you can get the individual pdf's for each variable by doing the integral of the other, called the **marginal density functions**. For example:  
$$f_X(x) = \int_{R_X(x)} f_{X,Y}(x, y) dy$$
- We can also say that *X* and *Y* are **independent** iff:  
$$f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)$$
    - Note also that this is the same as independence of two events:  
    $$P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1) P(E_2)$$  
    $$P(X \in A, Y \in B) = P (X \in A) P(Y \in B)$$  
    where A and B are all subsets of the range of X and Y, respectively

Ex1: For the following joint pdf independent?
$$f_{XY}(x, y) = 2x + y, 0 \lt x \lt 1, -\frac{1}{2} \lt y \lt \frac{1}{2}$$
- SOLN:  
Need to check if the following is true:  
$$f_{XY} (x,y) = f_X(x) f_Y(y)$$  
To do this, we would need to get the integral of the equation to get the marginal density functions:  
$$f_X(x) = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} f_{XY}(x, y) dy$$  
$$= \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} (2x+y) dy$$  
$$= 2xy + \frac{y^2}{2} |_{-1/2}^{1/2}$$  
$$= 2x(1/2) + \frac{(1/2)^2}{2}) - (2x(-1/2) + \frac{(-1/2)^2}{2}))$$  
$$= x + \frac{1}{8} + x - \frac{1}{8}$$  
$$f_X(x) = 2x, 0 \lt x \lt 1$$  
Furthermore, we will do this for Y:  
$$f_Y(y) = \int_0^1 (2x + y) dx$$  
$$= 2(\frac{x^2}{2}) + y*x |_0^1$$  
$$1^2 + y*1 - (0^2 + y*0)$$
$$f_Y(y) = y+1, -1/2 \lt y \lt 1/2$$  
Finally, we will list everything and check for independence:  
$$f_{XY}(x, y) = 2x + y$$  
$$f_X(x)f_Y(y) = 2x(y+1) = 2xy + 2x$$  
**Therefore, we can see the original function does not hold ($f_{XY} \neq f_Xf_Y$), and therefore X and Y are not independent**

Further independence notes
- Notice that if *X* and *Y* are independent, then:  
$$E(XY) =  \int \int_\mathbb{R} xy f_{X, Y}(x, y) dx dy$$
$$= (\int_\mathbb{R} x f_X(x) dx)(\int_\mathbb{R} y f_Y(y) dy)$$
$$= E(X) E(Y)$$
- For any *nice* function $h(x, y)$, $h(X, Y)$ is a random variable, and we have the expected value of $h(X, Y)$ is:  
$$E(h(X, Y)) = \int \int_{AAA finish}$$
- Given X and Y CRV's with join pdf $f_{X, Y}(x, y)$, the **covariance** of *X* and *Y* is defined as:  
$$\sigma_{XY} := E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)$$
Furthermore, we can look at the following two equations to get the third equation for covariance, or *cov*:
$$\sigma^2_X = V(X) = E[(X - \mu_X)^2]$$
$$\sigma^2_Y = V(Y) = E[(Y - \mu_Y)^2]$$
$$cov(X, Y) = \sigma_{XY} = E[(x - \mu_X)(y - \mu_Y)]$$

Ex2: Using the same functions as the last example:  
$$f_{XY}(x, y) = 2x + y, 0 \lt x \lt 1, -\frac{1}{2} \lt y \lt \frac{1}{2}$$  
$$f_X(x) = 2x, 0 \lt x \lt 1$$  
$$f_Y(y) = y + 1, -1/2 \lt y \lt 1/2$$
What is the covariance?
- SOLN:  
First, we need to get the expected value for X and Y, together and separately:  
$$E[XY] = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \int_0^1 x y (2x + y) dx dy$$
$$= \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \int_0^1 (2x^2y + xy^2) dx dy$$
$$= \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} 2 (\frac{x^3}{3}) y + (\frac{x^2}{2})y^2 |_0^1 dy$$  
$$= \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} (\frac{2}{3} y + \frac{y^2}{2}) dy$$  
$$= \frac{2}{3} * \frac{y^2}{2} + \frac{1}{2} * \frac{y^3}{3} |_{-1/2}^{1/2}$$
$$ = 1/24$$
Now for X:  
$$E[X] = \int_0^1 x f_X(x) dx$$  
$$= \int_0^1 x * 2x dx$$ 
$$= \int_0^1 2x^2 dx$$ 
$$= 2(\frac{x^3}{3}) |_0^1$$  
$$= 2/3$$
