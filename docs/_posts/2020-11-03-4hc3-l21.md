Assignment 6 Explanation & Code Demo
===


- Building an *interactive prototype* should truly be just that
    - Enough hardcoded data to do a usability test
    - Don't try to implement entire application functionality
- Going over A6 in lecture
    - Use code posted with assignment
    - Code demo for map in lecture for VUI
    - Ideas can sprawl across many different things
    - Don't worry about background talking setting off the interface
