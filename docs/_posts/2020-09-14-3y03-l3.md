Further Set Questions
===

**Multiplication Rules**
- **Q1**: Flip two coins, how many outcomes are in the sample space?  
SOLN:  
Each coin has 2 possible outcomes, each independent of one another,  
$n_1 = n_2 = 2$  
Therefore, the number of outcomes in this sample space is:  
**$n_1 x n_2 = 2 x 2 = 4$**
- **Q2**: Draw a card, stop if you get a club/heart, otherwise draw one more card and then stop.  How many outcomes are in the sample space?  
SOLN:  
We begin with the first card draw. We can only have four possible cases of card draw results (S, C, H, D). For C and H, that is the end of the experiment, and there is no following move. For S and D, there are another four possible outcomes. This can be done through tree diagrams, but also through case analysis:  
**Case I**: This experiment has only 1 step, with 2 possible outcomes, therefore:  
$n_1 = 2$  
**Case II**: This experiment has 2 steps, $n_1$ is for getting S or C, and $n_2$ is for any other card, therefore:  
$n_1 = 2$, $n_2 = 4$  
$n_1 x n_2 = 8$  
**Final**: Combine Case I and Case II:  
**$2 + 8 = 10$**

**Permutations and Combinations**
- We have n objects, and we would like to select objects from them. How many different selections do we have?
- Key difference between the two is **order** (permutations care about order, combinations do not)
- **Q1**: Suppose a hospital office has to schedule 2 brain surgeries, 3 knee surgeries, and 1 shoulder surgery.
    - How many possible schedules can we have?  
    SOLN:  
    Some examples of a schedule can be as follows:  
    b b k k k s  
    b k b k k s  
    Note though, there is no specification of two surgeries of the same type (ie no difference between the 3 knee surgeries), it is a **permutation of similar objects**.
        - The equation for calculating this type of permutation is as follows:  
        For n objects with r types of object, with $n_1$, $n_2$, ... $n_r$ objects of each type, the amount of permutations is:  
        **$\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2! ... n_r!}$**
    - Using this equation, we can now fill in these values:  
    r = 3 (brain, knee, shoulder)  
    $n_1$ = 2  
    $n_2$ = 3  
    $n_3$ = 1  
    n = $n_1 + n_2 + n_3$ = 6  
    Therefore, the number of possible schedules is:  
    **$\frac{6!}{2!3!1!} = 60$**
- **Q2**: Assume we have a batch of 75 semi-conductors. 70 are standard, and 5 are not.
    - Randomly select 3 samples from this batch, what's the number of selections we can have?  
    SOLN:  
    There is no differentials between semi-conductors, so we don't care about order. This makes this question a **combination** question. 
        - If you have n objects and select r from them, ignoring order, the number of selections is:  
        **$\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$**
    - In this question,  
    n = 75  
    r = 3  
    therefore, the number of possible selections is:   
    **$\frac{75!}{3!(75-3!)}$**
    - How many selections will have exactly 2 standard chips?  
    SOLN:  
    This is a two-step experiment, getting the choice of one non-standard and 2 standard ones, giving us:  
    **${5 \choose 1} x {70 \choose 2}$**
