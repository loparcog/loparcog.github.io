Deadline Monotonic (DM) Algorithm
===

Deadline Monotonic
- Another fixed priority scheduler
- Priorities based on relative deadlines: the shorter the deadline, the higher the priority
    - If every task has the period equal to relative deadline, it's the same as RM
- For arbitrary deadlines, DM algorithm performs better than RM
- May sometimes produce a feasible schedule when RM can't
    - RM algorithm will **always fail** if DM fails
- Examples of DM vs RM in slides

Dynamic-Priority Scheduling: Earliest-Deadline First (EDF)
- In this algorithm, the task priorities are **not fixed**, but change depending upon the closeness of their *absolute deadlines* (release time + relative deadline)
    - The processor always executes a task whose absolute deadline is the earliest
    - If more than one task has the same absolute deadlines, EDF randomly selects one for execution next
- Ex: $T_1 (5, 2), T_2 (7, 4)$
    - RM/DM scheduling is:  
    $T_1, T_1, T_2, T_2, T_2, T_1, T_1$  
    Deadline missed for task 2
    - EDF scheduling is:  
    $T_1, T_1, T_2, T_2, T_2, \bold{T_2}, T_1, T_1, T_2, T_2, T_2, T_2, T_1, T_1, T_2, T_1...$
- EDF is an **optimal** uniprocessor scheduling algorithm, which means if EDF cannot feasibly schedule a task set on a uniprocessor, there is no other scheduling algorithm that can
- EDF Schedulability Tests
    - Test 1: A set of n periodic tasks, each of whose *relative deadline is equal to or greater than its period*, can be feasibly scheduled by EDF iff:  
    $$\sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{e_i}{p_i}) \leq 1$$  
    - Test 2: No simple test is available in the case where *the relative deadlines are not equal to or greater than their periods*. In such cases, the best course of action is to develop a schedule using EDF to see if all deadlines are met over a given interval of time
        - A sufficient condition for such cases is:  
        $$\sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{e_i}{\min(D_i, p_i)}) \leq 1$$
        - Only sufficient condition, **NOT NECESSARY** - if it fails the task set may or may not be EDF schedulable
        - If $D_i \geq p_i$, this reduces to Test 1, otherwise this is just a sufficient condition
- Comparison of RM and EDF
    - EDF is more flexible and has **better utilization** than RM
    - Timing behaviour of a system scheduled with RM algorithm is more **predictable**
    - In case of overload, RM is stable in the presence of missed deadlines: same lower priority tasks miss the deadlines every time and there is **no effect on higher priority tasks**
    - In case of EDF, its difficult to predict which tasks will miss their deadlines during overloads. Also note a late task that has already missed its deadline has a **higher priority** than a task whose deadline is coming up



Lab 4 Info
- Focus on scheduling real-time tasks, creating multiple periodic tasks, synchronizing concurrent tasks using mutex, and using different scheduling policies, observing their consequences
- Documentation and task info to read is in the slides
- **Lab 4 will last for 3 weeks, longer than previous labs**
