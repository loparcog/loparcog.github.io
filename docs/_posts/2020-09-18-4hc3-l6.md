Event-Driven Programming
===

**Web Programming**
- We'll be covering architectural aspects of building modern web interfaces in this course
- Should be basic for SE students
    - W3Schools and MDN Web Docs recommended 
- Allows us to bring interactive prototypes
    - Sticking to mockups would miss a lot of the CS/SE involved in the interactivity of interfaces
- Technology and architects matter for good UI with respect to UI goals
    - Performance, subjective satisfaction, etc.
- Front-end has a reputation for being less challenging, but things have advanced, and got a bit more complex and confusing
- Foundational technologies:
    - HTML - structure
    - CSS - style
    - JS - behavior
        - These are so ubiquitous that more apps and things outside of websites are built using this (playstation apps, chromecast apps, etc.)
- Browser renders websites using HTML and CSS
    - Actually an expensive operation, especially in modern websites with 10k - 100k HTML elements
- Browsers interpret and execute JS code
    - Browser essentially compiler and OS, see ChromeOS
- The **Document Object Model (DOM)** can be manipulated with JS, allowing us to create/edit HTML elements themselves
    - DOM manipulation is key to making sites interactive
- Typical backend architecture is a server/client arch
- Event-drive programming
    - Write programs to deal with events happening in real time like keystrokes, mouse clicks/movement, etc.
    - Control flow in a "standard" python app would be dictated by control structures and function calls, would not be able to handle events how we want
        - How to get the program to respond to input at any time w/o pause?
    - Control flow is determined by events such as user actions
        - Dominant paradigm for GUI's
        - Can also be used for other situations, eg. I/O generally defined (network traffic, interprocess messaging, etc.)
    - **Event Handlers** are functions written to handle events
        - Connect event handlers to run when specific event takes place
        - Can optionally be given information about event as an argument (ie. mouse position)
    - **Event Loop** is a loop constantly checking for events occurring, and when one is received, the given event handler function is called
        - May be a queue of events handled one at a time or events handled in parallel, depends on implementation
        - Also referred to as main loop since it's the main source of program control flow
        - Games work similarly
- Demo in lecture to go through some event-driven programming, basic JS onclick handling
    - Look @ recording for more info
