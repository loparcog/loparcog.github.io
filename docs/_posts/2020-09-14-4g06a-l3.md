Engineering Capstone 4G06A
===

Prof: Alan Wassyng / wassyng@mcmaster.ca

Info
- Software projects can just be software, no need for a hardware component
    - That being said though, hardware can be thrown in
    - But, if you are with tron students, you **will** need some sort of hardware as well
    - Embedded systems will still require some embedded design in the project
        - Don't need a bunch of electronics or anything, could even just be doing an app on a smartphone and it would count
- Electronics would be out of pocket, machining and working @ Mac is unknown at the time
- All dates are on the outline, currently just looking to form a group and project goals

TODO
===
- Group, project choice, justification, and project goals, all due on October 4th 2020
