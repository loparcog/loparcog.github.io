TA: Shusheng Li / lis174@mcmaster.ca


Outline
- Major focus on real-time systems and scheduling algorithms
    - Also an intro to digital control systems
- Labs will focus on
    - Fulfilling engineering degree reqs
    - Enrich your experience dealing the RT systems and applications
    - Helps understanding of concepts and algorithms
    - Will be done remotely (duh)
    - Mostly focussing on C
- Labs will have manuals and pre-lab work to be done
    - Previous years had labs in groups of two, but now will be done individually
- All course materials will be held on Avenue, and labs will be formatted to work for individuals rather than pairs
    - Can discuss with others though for lab work
- Labs start on second week with a safety quiz
- Each lab goes for two weeks, except Lab 4 which takes 3 weeks
    - Makeup labs can be done if needed on week of Nov 30th, but need to be done by appointment
- To prepare for labs
    - On Thursday in class before a lab, a TA will give an instruction for the lab in the following weeks
    - Read the handout *carefully* before lab sessions. If you have any questions ask your TA
    - Try to finish the lab as early as possible. If it's done in the first week, you don't need to show up for the second
    - If you have a linux system at home, you can work on these labs at home on there, but you will be required to display your results by connecting to the MyRio system
    - If you need to reschedule, you will need let a TA know beforehand
        - **Any missed lab w/o prior notice is not allowed for a make-up lab**
- No textbook, a lot of reference books though for individual consumption
- Discussion can be done through Avenue

Grading
- Labs > 30%
    - 5 individual labs
- Midterm > 30%
    - October 20th
- Final > 40%
    - Date TBD
- There will also be quizzes but they will not be counted in the final grade
    - Mainly used to see how well someone understands the materials
    - There are "participation points" though, essentially meaning if you participate more and you get a bit more recognized then your mark can be bumped up if it is on the borderline
