Confidence Interval on the Mean of a Normal Distribution, **Variance Known**
- An interval estimate for a population parameter is called a **confidence interval**
- Suppose $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ is a random sample from the normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and known variance $\sigma^2$, then the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, we may standardize $\bar{X}$ by:  
$$Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$
- A confidence interval estimate for $\mu$ is an interval of the form $l \leq \mu \leq u$, where the endpoints *l* and *u* are computed from the sample data
    - Because difference samples produce different values of *l* and *u*, these end-points are values of random variables *L* and *U* respectively. Suppose we can determine values of *L* and *U* such that the following probability statement is true:  
    $$P(L \leq \mu \leq U) = 1 - \alpha$$  
    where $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. There is a probability of $1 - \alpha$ of selecting a sample for which the CI will contain the true value of $\mu$
    - The end points are called the lower and upper confidence limits (bounds), and $1 - \alpha$ is called the **confidence coefficient**
- If $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean of a random sample of size *n* from a normal population with known variance $\sigma^2$, a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval on $\mu$ is given by:  
$$\bar{X} - z_{\alpha / 2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \mu \leq \bar{X} + z_{\alpha / 2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$  
where $z_{\alpha / 2}$ is the value such that $\phi(z_{\alpha / 2}) = \alpha / 2$
- If $\bar{x}$ is used as an estimate of $\mu$, we can be $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confident that the error $|\bar{x} - \mu|$ will not exceed a specified amount *E* when the sample size is:  
$$n = \left(\frac{z_{\alpha / 2} \sigma}{E}\right)^2$$

Confidence Interval on the Mean of a Normal Distribution, **Variance Unknown**
- Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ be a random sample from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and unknown variance $\sigma^2$. The random variable:  
$$T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{S / \sqrt{n}}$$  
has a *t* distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom
- A $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval on $\mu$ is given by:  
$$\bar{x} - t_{\alpha / 2, n-1} s/\sqrt{n} \leq \mu \leq \bar{x} + t_{\alpha / 2, n-1} s/\sqrt{n}$$  
where $t_{\alpha / 2, n-1}$ is the upper $100\alpha/2$ percentage point of the *t* distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom

Large-Sample Confidence Interval for a (Binomial) Population Proportion
- If *n* is large, the distribution of:  
$$Z = \frac{X - np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}} = \frac{\hat{P} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}$$  
is approximately standard normal, where $\hat{P} = X/n$
- A $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval on the proportion *p* of the population that belongs to this class is:  
$$\hat{p} - z_{\alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \leq p \leq \hat{p} + z_{\alpha / 2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$  
where $z_{\alpha / 2}$ is the upper $\alpha / 2$ percentage point of the standard normal distribution
- The sample size for a given error value is:  
$$n - \left( \frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{E} \right)^2 p(1-p)$$
