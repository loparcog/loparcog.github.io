Probability Examples
===

Ex1: Flip 3 coins. Win $1 whenever I get a head. X is a random variable of how much money I get in this experiment. 
- The possible values for X is:  
$X = (0, 1, 2, 3) = (TTT), (HTT, THT, TTH), (HHT, HTH, THH), (HHH)$  
There are 8 outcomes in total, each divided amongst the possible values of X. The probability of these values of X are:  
$P(X=0) = P([TTT]) = \frac{1}{8}$  
$P(X=1) = P([HTT,  THT, TTH]) = \frac{3}{8}$  
$P(X=2) = \frac{3}{8}$  
$P(X=3) = \frac{1}{8}$  
NOTE: The random variable is given here and will be given in early questions, but it is always based on something we are interested in for a question that can take on multiple values

Assignment Qs:
- Q6: 15 day shift, 13 swing, and 9 graveyard, select 6
    - a) Probability all 6 are from the same shift?  
    SOLN:  
    P(select 6 from day) + P(select 6 from swing) + P(select 6 from graveyard)  
    Total workers = 37  
    $P(day) = \frac{\binom{15}{6}}{\binom{37}{6}}$  
    Do the same with others and add them together
    - b) Probability **at least** 2 different shifts represented  
    SOLN:  
    This is the same as saying everyone is not from one shift, just do 1 - a)
    - c) Probability exactly 3 come from the day shift  
    SOLN:  
    This would be 3 from day and 3 from other, making the numerator 2 parts:  
    $\frac{\binom{15}{3} * \binom{(13 + 9)}{3}}{\binom{37}{6}}$
- Q7: A system has given defects with given probability systems. Find the probability that the system has...  
    - a) Exactly 2/3 defects  
    SOLN:  
    Draw it out in a venn diagram, we can calculate the intersections given:  
    $P(A_1 \cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) - P(A_1 \cap A_2)$  
    Do this for all and add up the intersections
    - b) Type 1 defect given it does not have Type 2 or 3  
    SOLN:  
    $P(A_1 \| (A_2 \cup A_3)')$  
    Look into demorgans for solving this
- Q10: Surgeries, 2 knee, 5 hip, and 6 shoulder, probability that
    - a) All knee surgeries completed first  
    - b) Probability that the schedule begins with a hip surgery given all the shoulder surgeries are last
    - **Look @ previous lectures for an example on this, email if it still doesn't make sense**
