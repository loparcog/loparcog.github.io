Reliability - Practical Considerations
===

NASA Tutorial Paper
- Given a target application with specified reliability and performance requirements
- Engineer's task is to design a system to meet the specified requirements
- How does one estimate reliability, availability, etc.?
    - **Dependency models**
- Common uses
    - Performance after design done (describe an existing system)
    - Not performed by design engineers
- Best uses
    - Through process to point to where design effort should be focused
    - "What-if" options
- Integration
    - Dependability analysis can identify where fault tolerance/redundancy is required
    - Allows refinement of designs
- Modelling Methods
    - Digraphs (yields direct probability expressions)
        - Don't worry too much about this
    - Combinatorial models (RBDs, fault trees)
    - Dynamic fault trees (adds sequencing, etc.)
        - Don't worry about this too much either
    - Markov models
    - Generalized stochastic petri nets
    - Hybrid/hierarchical
    - Simulation
- What we've done (on board)
    - Time-Dependent solutions
        - CTMC for limiting probabilities
        - Mean time to failure (MTTF)
        - Example in video, main takeaway is there is more that can be done than MTTF and limiting probabilities
- Types of CTMCs
    - Homogeneous (what we talked about)
    - Non-homogeneous (transition rates not constants, $\lambda(t), \mu(t)$)
    - Semi-Markov (memoryless at discrete time points)
        - Beyond the scope of this course
- Models for types of fault tolerance
    - Transient/intermittent faults, imperfect coverage, spares, etc.

IBM Websphere Paper - Hierarchical Model
- Thee level hierarchical model
- Compare with one model: difficulties?
    - Deals with reliability of systems with separate models (eg. one CTMC, one simulation)
- Similar to modularity

Scheduling and the Impact of Variability
- Gaining insight into how randomness affects system performance
- M/G/1 Queue
    - Arrivals follow a Poisson process, rate $\lambda$
    - Processing times follow a general distribution, mean $1/\mu$ and second moment $E[S^2]$
    - Processing is FCFS
