Network of Queues
===

Open Networks
- Consider the network given in lecture
    - Nodes with possible arrivals from outside or from other nodes (external arrivals vs routing), jobs can leave the system or come back (feedback possible)
- Arrivals- external arrivals follow a Poisson process with rate $r_i$ to node *i* ($r_i = 0$ means no external arrivals to node *i*)
- Each node has an infinite buffer and a single server, processing times exponentially distributed with rate
- **Routing**: Job exiting node *i* goes to node *j* with probability $P_{ij}$
- Assumption: All arriving jobs eventually leave the system (do not confuse this with stability)
- Can be represented as a CTMC, with $Q_i$ representing the queue of node *i*:  
$$X(t) = (Q_1(t), Q_2(t), ..., Q_N(t))$$ 
    - Note this does not follow the birth-death process
- Balance Equarions
    - Could write them for each state, but this is somewhat cumbersome. First, let:  
    AAA (finish)
    - Suppose that all $n_i \gt 0$, we get the rate in = rate out:  
    $$\sum_{i=1}^N (r_i + \mu_i)\pi_{\bar{n}}$$  
    $$=\sum_{i=1}^N r_i \pi_{\bar{n} - \bar{e_i}} + sum_{i=1}^N \mu_i P_{i, out} \pi_{\bar{n} + \bar{e_i}} + sum_{i=1}^N sum_{j=1}^N \mu_j P_{ji} \pi_{\bar{n} + \bar{e_j} - \bar{e_i}}$$  
    In addition, there are all of te boundary states (all combinations of $n_i = 0$ to take into account)
- **Traffic Equations**
    - Could try to solve the balance equations, but first, let's write down equations for the arrival rate to node *i* (if the system were stable):  
    $$\lambda_i = r_i + \sum_{j = 1}^N P_{ji} \lambda_j, i=1, 2, ..., N$$  
    These are known as the *traffic equations*
- Limiting Distribution
    - It turns out that we have the following solution to the balance equations:  
    $$\pi_{\bar{n}} = \Pi_{i=1}^N \pi^i_{n_i}$$  
    $$\pi^i_{n_i} = (1 - \frac{\lambda_i{\mu_i}})(\frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_i})^{n_i}$$
    - *Product-Form* Solution - Probabilities are a product of quantities as one queue only
    - Dependence through traffic equations
    - Similar results if $c_i$ servers at each node - $\pi_{n_i}^i$ is the corresponding probability for an M/M/$c_i$ system
- Product-Form Solution
    - Suggests that queues are "independent" of each other
    - This is true for a single snapshot of the network taken at a single point in time
    - Two snapshots taken at two (close) time instants will exhibit strong correlations

Example in lecture
- Steps of solving:
    1. Recognize open network (open meaning jobs arriving and leaving)
    2. Solve traffic equations
    3. Check if solution is valid ($\lambda_i \lt \mu_i$)
    4. Determing whatever performance metric you're looking for

Bottleneck Analysis
- Bottleneck is node with largest load (consistent with Operational Analysis)
- Improving the situation at the bottleneck maximizes performance improvement

Closed Networks
- *M* jobs in the system - none leave, no more enter
- $r_i = 0, \sum_{j=1}^N P_{ij} = 1$  
- Here, the traffic equations are:  
$$\lambda_i = \sum_{j=1}^N P_{ji} \lambda_j$$
