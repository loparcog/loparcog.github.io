Digital Controller in Continuous Control Systems
- In reality, the plant to be controlled is likely to be a continuous control system (CCS)
- Have developed pretty mature theories and techniques to analyze and design a continuous controller
- What if we want to use a digital controller instead of continuous controller?
- Time shifting property of Z-transform
    - By definition:  
    $$Z[f(k)] = F(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(k) z^{-k}$$  
    Therefore,  
    $$Z[f(k-1)] = F(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} f(k-1) z^{-k}$$  
    - Let $n = k-1$,  
    $$Z[f(k-1)] = F(z) = \sum_{n=-1}^{\infty} f(n) z^{-(n+1)}$$  
    - Since $f(-1) = 0$,  
    $$Z[f(k-1)] = F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f(n) z^{n} z^-1$$

- Z-domain representation of delay in time domain
    - A delay in the time domain corresponds to the z-transform of the signal without delay, multiplied by a power of z:

- CSS to DCS (Digital control system)
    - Assume the transfer function of a continuous controller is given by:  
    $$D(s) = \frac{U(s)}{E(s)} = K_0 \frac{s+a}{s+b}$$  
    where $U(s)$ is the transfer function of the output $u(t)$ and $E(s)$ is the transfer function of the input (error signal) $e(t)$ to the controller
    - The objectives is to find the difference equations to be programmed into AAA (finish)
- Obtain difference equation
    - Cross multiplication gives:  
    $$U(s)(s+b) = K_0 E(s)(s+a)$$  
    Note $sU(s) \to u'(t)$ if $U(s) \to u(t)$
    Hence,  
    $$u'(t) + bu(t) = K_0 e'(t) + aK_0 e(t)$$  
    - Recall Euler's Method,  
    $$u' = \lim_{\delta t \to 0} \frac{\delta u}{\delta t}$$
