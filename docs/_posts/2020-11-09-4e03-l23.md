Simulation Packages
- It would be nice if this were to some degree automated - CSIM is one means
    - CSIM: Found on mesquite.com
    - SimPy: Used in conjunction with Python
    - R: Statistics calculation language, has support for simulations
    - Arena: Costs money but also good
- C code example in lecture video
    - Takeaway is this C simulation package exists, documentation is available on the CAS server
    - Also note that writing simulations from scratch works too, even not using C simulation

Output Analysis
- Suppose that we had one long trace of response time observations. The initial transient could potentially bias the results. Potential remedies for this include:
    1. Discard the first *k* observations, for some suitably chosen value of *k*. One possibility would be to discard the first 10% of the trace
    2. Eyeball the results and do transient removal in an ad hoc, intuitive manner
    3. Simulate so long that the effect of the initial transient period is negligible
- Suppose that $r_k$ is the response time of the *k*th job in the trace
    - Using $r_k$ values themselves to construct a CI is problematic, as consecutive observations are not independent
    - AAA (finish)

Independent Replicas
- Repeat the simulation *N* times, each time using a different seed for the PRNG
- If run *i* has average statistic $Y_i$, we now have *N* independent observations $(Y_i)$
- Pro - straightforward (used in practice as well)
- Con - must do transient removal for each run and not clear how large *N* should be

Run-Length Control
- Choosing a fixed *N* value may not be satisfying for results
    - CI may not be satisfactory
- Can do "run-length" control
- Loop to add a replication, compute the CI, and keep going until the CI is "good enough"
    - Good enough would be something like the width of the CI being less than or equal to 10% of the average
